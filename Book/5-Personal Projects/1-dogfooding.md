When working on personal projects, it can be difficult to keep focus. In fact, one of the most common jokes between developers is the fact that we all have a big number of half-finished, non-functioning projects that we all swore to get back to one day but didn't and never will. And you'll be there, too. One day, inspiration will hit and you'll hit the ground running until you're tired at which point you'll leave that piece of ground forever.

The idea behind starting a project strong and keeping it up is that of "momentum". Momentum is the steady advancement of a project. Long-term projects often suffer from keeping up that momentum until they fall into disrepair while many short-term projects suffer from building it up. It's a psychological effect with real-world consequences.

For instance, the longer you stay away from a project, the longer it will take you to get back into it. If you stay away too long, you may need to update dependencies, frameworks, software/hardware, etc. thus keeping you further away from actually accomplishing something. Outside of that, losing momentum can quickly deprioritize a project and may even push into the project graveyard.

It's even more crucial to personal projects because those don't have financial backing or a PM to keep you on your toes. In fact, there is little incentive behind the project to keep it going. There's no reward at the end, nor a pat on the back for getting the job done.

Which is how we come to the concept of dogfooding.

###Build for your needs

Dogfooding, in a simple sense, is the concept of building to satisfy your own needs. Not just learning needs or creativity, but real-life needs that could be solved by an application. The need has to be strong enough to keep yourself working under that motivation.

A great example of this is a snippet library. A snippet library is a library of snippets, or short samples of code, that some developers keep around to use and reuse in various projects. These snippets could be Regex, utility functions (possibly a camelCase to snake\_case converter), and even entire HTML layouts. Snippet libraries have to have clean code that could be used anywhere otherwise it's useless.

If a snippets library contains some non-abstracted garbage and requires other services, and things you really don't actually need to use some function, you'll abandon it quickly.

However, if you manage to write clean code and save it into your snippets, you may find yourself using it more often than not. And the more you use it, the more you'll want to make it useful. Possibly by separating snippets by language, by utility vs specific function, categories, etc. And maybe you want to go back to older projects and try to recover more work because the more you build into your project, the faster you will be at your job.

So look around and see what your needs are. Maybe you need a to-do list that works unlike any other on the market currently. Build it, use it, and use it so much that you'll want to upgrade it and keep working on it. Maybe you want to build a Wordpress theme that will serve as boilerplate. The brilliant thing about that is that the more work you do on your boilerplate, the less you will have to do for your individual projects.

Again, satisfy your needs. Keep using and building the product.

###Build with purpose and build deep

To go back to some of what I talked about. It's important to build with a purpose. It's easy to build throwaway projects but not very useful. Long-term projects help us keep up with technology, update and upgrade, and test technology out. For example, let's say you built a random To-do list app with no special twist to it. There's no sense in it, there are a million others.

And once you're done, or once you explore the technology you wanted to explore, you'll abandon it, a half-build house. If you actually follow through, you may learn more than just the basic syntax of that technology.

Let's consider the framework AngularJS. Angular's adopters are usually categorized as either enthusiastic beginners or dreadful masters. What that means is that when you start using Angular, you'll feel elated. It's a somewhat complicated framework but it's VERY powerful. It feels like the right solution to every problem. An every-man's hammer.

But when you master it, you'll start to find the ugly parts and realize how dreadful it can be working with it. Of course, there are two sides to every argument but it's a great example as to why you should follow through.

Building a full-scale application or at least finishing one, helps you set up for true iterative work. Iterative work means that when you remember that project and think to yourself, "Oh yeah, that app, I've been wanting to test a new feature X", you can go straight to it and iterate, giving a you deeper overview to the technology itself. If you started a new app just to test that feature X, you would not get this overview. This makes the applications even more self-serving.

Finishing an app is a grand feeling so give that a shot.
