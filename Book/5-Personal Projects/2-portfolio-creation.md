Portfolios are very important for designers; however, they've been increasingly more important for developers as well. Creating your portfolio can be a daunting task but once done, it can be refreshing, useful, and you'll be glad you did it. It's a great way to show off your work, to force yourself to finish projects, and to re-evaluate your skillsets over time.

###Showing off

Obviously, portfolios are about showing off. As far as jobs go, many hiring managers don't understand code concepts and want solid proof of your work. The best way to do it is by linking them to a portfolio and telling them what you did on each project.

Unfortunately, a lot of the times, you won't be able to take credit for the work you've done for a company, client, or while contracting. In fact, some of the highest profile clients don't want to share who's done the work. And that's fine. But it sucks for you as a developer. There are contractual obligations that will prohibit you from disclosing what you've done and where (this is often called an NDA: Non-disclosure agreement). I may or may not have signed a few myself.

That means being inventive. One of the coolest ideas I've seen around is treating yourself both as the developer and client. Meaning that you *hire* yourself to do a project, perhaps your own personal website. The experience will help you see both sides of the fences, and on top of that, you'll come out with a portfolio piece client-like project.

You can even document your work along the way. From brainstorming to alpha, to the final version and post it as a blogpost, a proof of your work.

Other times, you're welcome to dogfood and build apps for yourself and post those are your portfolio pieces. I've used my personal Wordpress boilerplate project on countless client projects that I can't show off but the boilerplate in itself is worth showing off.

A portfolio should always be presentable and hold only the best work you have so make sure not to saturate it with half-done projects, links to sites that no longer exist, and work too old to even show.

###Finishing work

An upside of building a portfolio from scratch is having to finish your projects. As you'll progress as a developer, you'll start to notice how *easy* it is to start a project but how much more difficult it is to finish it. It's the same in the professional world as it is in your personal development. Large companies can easily launch *initiatives* and just as easily abandon it without finishing it and testing it out.

Portfolios require *done* work so they force you to actually do what you need to do.

###Re-evaluating Skills

One cool thing about portfolios is that they're a snapshot into your skillset. Just having a six month span of projects will show you just how far you've come. It can astonishing but very awesome to be able to re-evaluate yourself in this manner.

For instance, I recently sent out a copy of my resume and realized that my portfolio was vastly out of date. I was working in the educational sector on a lot of back-end work. Back-end work is very difficult to showcase but I tried nevertheless. What was impressive was how far I've come. I checked out a project from earlier in the year and could not believe how messy and inefficient I used to be! "I wouldn't do *that* today!" I told myself but I already know I will the next time I check my portfolio. I'll see that my code today is just as messy!

Outside of that, I looked at my solutions and realized that my knowledge today would definitely help me up with a better more scalable solution. It was a nice moment. It also taught me where I've spent a lot of my time learning. Looking through other projects, however, I realized that I haven't advanced much at all and that was mostly because I wasn't practicing skills associated with that project.
