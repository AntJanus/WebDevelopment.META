Part of the life of a developer is working on personal projects. They're important because they're a sandbox of ideas, expression, and learning. It's the equivalent of a gym for sports athletes. It's where we practice our cutting edge skills, try out new frameworks, and use architecture patterns that probably don't make sense anywhere else. It's just how lion cubs practice hunting by playing games with their siblings.

That is, until that knowledge comes in extremely useful. You see, more often than not, honing our skills via personal projects has real-life application to your work. That new framework you tested may come in handy, or perhaps it sparked an idea on how to solve a current problem. Better yet, your side work could become crucial to your main work as a dependency.

Regardless of how you get into it, working on personal projects is not just helpful but rewarding. It can help stimulate creativity, stave off burnout (by helping you vary what you work on), and even give you a better place to show off your skills.
