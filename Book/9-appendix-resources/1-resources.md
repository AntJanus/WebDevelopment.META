title: Resources
----
content:

The problem with many helpful books is that they do not point you in the direction of where to go next. Either there is a vague alusion to "waiting for the sequel" or there is some broad reaching advice like "read source code!" or "work on your project!"

This section is supposed to supplement and add onto everything I've written. Many of the resources here can be found throughout the book so treat this as a reading list and check whatever tickles your fancy. I'll categorize most of these by the section that's relevant and others by new sections not covered in this book.

I'll also mention a few helpful sites.

####Site List

- [Salary.com](http://salary.com) - a site where you can go to estimate the average pay for someone with your skillset. Take it with a grain of salt and treat it as a soft estimate.
