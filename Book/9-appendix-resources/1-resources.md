title: Resources
----
content:

The problem with many helpful books is that they do not point you in the direction of where to go next. Either there is a vague alusion to "waiting for the sequel" or there is some broad reaching advice like "read source code!" or "work on your project!"

This section is supposed to supplement and add onto everything I've written. Many of the resources here can be found throughout the book so treat this as a reading list and check whatever tickles your fancy. I'll categorize most of these by the section that's relevant and others by new sections not covered in this book.

I'll also mention a few helpful sites.

###Learning

####Reading list

####Site List

- HabitRPG - HabitRPG is gamified habit-learning website. It'll help you get into the habit of learning and coding for your site. There are many support groups there.

###Getting Employed

####Reading list

####Site List

- [Salary.com](http://salary.com) - a site where you can go to estimate the average pay for someone with your skillset. Take it with a grain of salt and treat it as a soft estimate.
- [Glassdoor](http://glassdoor.com) - similar site to salary.com but offers salary information in specific companies based on user submissions. Great way to gauge room to grow and what you should ask for.
