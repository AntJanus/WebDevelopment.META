There are many important points along a web developers career path that require a decision. You can always go back on your decision but it's important to know it's there. These career path will set your field, your job market, and even your pay in the future.

I'm basically talking about specialization. Just as an engineer may specialize in waterworks, a developer can specialize in DevOps.

You may have made some of these decisions yourself so it's time to find out if you made the right decision or what it may have cost you.

## The Programming Side

Let's first discuss the general developer. Outside of programming language and framework specialization, there are several other career paths.

### DevOps

Or Development Operations is a career path for a developer that wants to focus on setting up servers for web development, creating testing environments, and a deployment strategy. This could involve spinning up new Virtual Machines or servers based on set IT protocols, creating bash scripts to install all the necessary software on it, or bypassing bash scripts and using more advanced tools like Ansible, Puppet, or Chef in order to have robust recreatable environments.

A DevOps person is an intermediate between a back-end developer and a system adminstrator. In some ways, they allow better communication between the two but many other ways, they're crucial to having a robust platform for your code. Outside of setting up servers, for instance, a DevOps person may setup a development environment using tools like Vagrant and Docker so that each developer can run their own small server with their code and be able to destroy/recreate it at their whim.

A DevOps professional can also be responsible for a testing environment such as setting up Continuous Integration so that all the code tests are run automatically on each Git commit. That person can also be doing many others things include setting up deployment strategy. A "deployment" is moving code from testing and development environments to a production server (your "live" server) in a safe and secure manner.

A deployment strategy is not just simple FTPing to the server (that's not a good idea anyways), it may involve setting up software for quick rollbacks (using an older version of the code in case something goes wrong), changing production server settings, updating the database with a code push, and much more.

In this path, you're entering a whole new world for developers because DevOps didn't exist several years ago and not until a year or so back did DevOps individuals become wanted and found crucial to smooth business operations for large companies.

### Back-end developer

I've discussed back-end vs front-end; however, working as a full-time developer on either side can be a much different experience. As a back-end developer, you will be responsible for the bulk of the business-logic (the code required to perform your business's specific duties), data storage, and communication with the front-end. This can be a daunting job; however, back-end languages have their charms and beauty. Back-end developers also usually don't have to focus on the look of the website, but rather deal with the programming aspect of it.

One of the greatest advantages of back-end code over front-end code is the wealth of languages you can use. From C\# to Python, PHP, Ruby, there are even C++ frameworks for the back-end, not to mention Java, Scala, and I could keep going while the front-end is limited to its Javascript and possibly you could count Dart (which compiles to JS anyways).
