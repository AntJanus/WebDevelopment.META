There are many important points along a web developers career path that require a decision. You can always go back on your decision but it's important to know it's there. These career path will set your field, your job market, and even your pay in the future.

I'm basically talking about specialization. Just as an engineer may specialize in waterworks, a developer can specialize in DevOps.

You may have made some of these decisions yourself so it's time to find out if you made the right decision or what it may have cost you.

## The Programming Side

Let's first discuss the general developer. Outside of programming language and framework specialization, there are several other career paths.

### DevOps

Or Development Operations is a career path for a developer that wants to focus on setting up servers for web development, creating testing environments, and a deployment strategy. This could involve spinning up new Virtual Machines or servers based on set IT protocols, creating bash scripts to install all the necessary software on it, or bypassing bash scripts and using more advanced tools like Ansible, Puppet, or Chef in order to have robust recreatable environments.

A DevOps person is an intermediate between a back-end developer and a system adminstrator. In some ways, they allow better communication between the two but many other ways, they're crucial to having a robust platform for your code. Outside of setting up servers, for instance, a DevOps person may setup a development environment using tools like Vagrant and Docker so that each developer can run their own small server with their code and be able to destroy/recreate it at their whim.

A DevOps professional can also be responsible for a testing environment such as setting up Continuous Integration so that all the code tests are run automatically on each Git commit. That person can also be doing many others things include setting up deployment strategy. A "deployment" is moving code from testing and development environments to a production server (your "live" server) in a safe and secure manner.

A deployment strategy is not just simple FTPing to the server (that's not a good idea anyways), it may involve setting up software for quick rollbacks (using an older version of the code in case something goes wrong), changing production server settings, updating the database with a code push, and much more.

In this path, you're entering a whole new world for developers because DevOps didn't exist several years ago and not until a year or so back did DevOps individuals become wanted and found crucial to smooth business operations for large companies.

### Back-end developer

I've discussed back-end vs front-end; however, working as a full-time developer on either side can be a much different experience. As a back-end developer, you will be responsible for the bulk of the business-logic (the code required to perform your business's specific duties), data storage, and communication with the front-end. This can be a daunting job; however, back-end languages have their charms and beauty. Back-end developers also usually don't have to focus on the look of the website, but rather deal with the programming aspect of it.

One of the greatest advantages of back-end code over front-end code is the wealth of languages you can use. From C\# to Python, PHP, Ruby, there are even C++ frameworks for the back-end, not to mention Java, Scala, and I could keep going while the front-end is limited to its Javascript and possibly you could count Dart (which compiles to JS anyways). This means that there is a wealth of paradigms to tackle, and many new paradigms that people test and try to advance.

Back-end developers usually don't deal with interactivity but create endpoints for front-end developers to hook into for that specific interactivity.

Back-end development is where you get to really get your programming chops on. These positions also offer the greatest range of employment since any large company that needs a developer, will most likely need a back-end developer. These positions are also paid the most since they deal with proper logic execution, performance, and everything else to do with making money.

### Full-stack developer

A full-stack developer tends to move between layers but the best way to describe one is by saying that a full-stack developer is great at two things: prototyping, and finishing products. By that I mean that a full-stack developer can be given a task and not only get the rudimentary business logic in place but also get the front-end started with basic interactivity.

This is great for full-time prototypers wherein, after a project's completion, a back-end developer can come in and put together a well architected solution and a front-end developer can come in and layer on some crazy interactions.

This is not to say that a full-stack developer cannot do both of those as well (some can, some can't); however, the point of a full-stack developer is not to get bogged down on either end.

As far as the "completion", this is to say that after the architecture is done, bulk of the back-end work, and the front-end, a full stack developer can come in to implement new features that span both sides.

As far as the work environment, full-stack developers don't often get specifically "full-stack" positions but rather can move in a company on both sides, or, when finding a new job, switch paradigms instantly. This offers a wide range but without being fully submerged on either end, it can be difficult to get into the highest paid ranges. I'd say that most developers are *somewhat* full-stack developers, knowing things somewhat well on both sides.

### Front-end developer

A front-end developer deals with what shows up in the browser. This can encompass interactivity, converting design to code, animations (nowadays), and sometimes even design. Front-end developers are famed as the "normal" people when it comes to programmers. I think that mostly has to do with the visual aspect of their work. Code changes and work is tangible rather than more abstract. And clients can see updates immediately, being able to view a "before" and "after" shot.

Front-end developers have the ability to shape the way a user interacts with their application. This can feel very powerful and can be extremely rewarding. A front-end developer may follow spec but usually it's up to them to figure out how to execute it.

Front-end developers, as far as programming goes, have to deal with front-end performance issues, being able to write code that works the same way across a myriad of devices and much more. While they are restricted to only one official cross-platform language, there are hundreds of libraries and many different paradigms to follow. It's also the place that's seemingly advancing the fastest in the landscape. From industry-changing frameworks to rapidly advancing browsers that can do more every year, a front-end developer can live "on the edge".

As a front-end developer, the job market varies from lucrative startups to a ton of freelance work for smaller businesses. As a front-end developer, you can make yourself quite a comfortable career. The big upside of this expertise is how quickly it's growing, how much demand is increasing and how much the career is becoming more coveted.

## As time goes by

As time goes by, you will have to make more difficult choices, and not just ones that involve which tech you work with. In fact, the more time goes by, the more you'll realize just how much everything is blending together. Front end and back end will start to resemble each other, and all languages will seem quite similar except for a few nuances. At that point, I'd say you achieved the Senior Developer level; however, your career wants may take you elsewhere.

Some people call developers "code monkeys" (which, in reality, sounds pretty offensive), and you may want to get away from that but still stay at the tech side. There are several opportunities you'll be faced with.

### Senior Developer (management heat: 0/10)

Not much a monkey, more of a gorilla that bangs its chest and lets everyone know what they should be doing. As a Senior Developer, you'll be in a unique position to mentor junior developers and partake in important technological decisions as well as handle the hardest challenges set before you. This is the position where you get to argue with other senior developers, with your manager, and everyone else about your position on a decision.

And it's important to argue and hold your ground, you're there specifically for your expertise. Senior Development still requires a lot of coding but some coding will be replaced with important decision-making on application architecture, white-boarding solutions to complicated problems, and estimating deadlines for larger projects. You'll focus more on creating an application that will last that others will work on.

There's a saying that you should write your code as if the next person to work on it is an OCD-driven serial killer that has your address. In this case, a senior developer is someone who is least likely to become the next victim because half their career is staked on making code that junior developers will be able to work with, update, and patch while they're off doing the next big thing.

Senior development is wonderful for all of those that want to keep coding but take on some responsibility while not leaving development altogether.

### Lead Developer (management heat: 3/10)

As a Lead Developer, you take on not just the senior developer role but also somewhat of a manager role. This means that you'll have responsibilities outside of your code such as some project management, estimation of deadlines, ability to speak with upper management about the problems you may be facing, and delegation of rules. This position ranges wildly depending on where you work.

Being a Lead Developer can mean anything from being the ONLY developer (startup) to being a Lead Developer of all developers currently working for a company (mid-size company) to being one among many lead developers that lead a team of specific developers (mid-size/enterprise). As a lead developer, you'll need inter-personal skills on top of your coding.

Many take on this role to not only have the final say (or as close as possible to it) over technology but also to have the ability to steer the entire development team where they see fit. A senior developer may argue but it's the Lead Developer that puts their foot down. In this case, a Lead Developer uses the senior staff to guide their decisions. This can offer its own challenges but its own set of rewards outside of coding such as a happy team, a productive team, and ability to change age-old practices at the company (such as not using version control).

It's definitely a worthwile career for anyone that wants to do more than just sit in front of a text editor trying to get at the next problem. It's definitely a career for someone who wants to be a leader.

### Project Manager (management heat: 5/10)

A project manager can work anywhere, not just in a tech field but let's discuss a high-profile project manager in tech. For this role, you'd be required to know more than just tech, you're required to know people. This career step requires you to be more "manager" and less "developer" in order to keep projects in a row. And it's a god-awful job if you can't figure out what makes people tick in your team.

So first of all, you'll need to be good at estimating deadlines and by that, I mean, you'll need to be good at knowing what a developer really means when they say "a couple of hours" because in some cases it could really mean a couple of hours, in others it could mean "6 months and half a million dollars". It'd be your job to figure out which is which and how to prioritize the task.

The joy of project management is orchestrating the wealth of resources under your hands to get a job done. It's about knowing the right people and distributing workload based on who can handle it, who can do it the best, and who can do it the quickest as well as keeping a good rotation of projects in order to not fatigue developers.

The developer part of this job is basically knowing developers because you've been one, and knowing when "simple changes" become horrendous nightmares. I would say that it's also the job of a project manager to estimate time in such a way that no corners can be cut.

Unfortunately, PMs can get a lot of flack, and many people just "don't believe in them". I believe that the nay-sayers have never experienced a good one.

### Manager (management heat: 10/10)

A manager is, simply, a manager. In the hierarchy of things, they're above a PM, above a Lead Developer, and above a developer. But they're also almost the furthest from code (usually). As a manager, you becomes responsible for your entire team, your projects, deadlines, and on top of that, all of the managerial tasks such as discipline, hiring, team coherence, complaints, etc.

If that was not enough, you're also THE person to have to meet with other managers and represent your team. You have to fight for your team, get involved in office politics, and take the heat for any failures of your underlinks. It's definitely not a job for everyone.

If I was to describe this job in one word, you're the "Shepherd" and your developers are your sheep while your PM is your dog helping you keep your sheep in line. As the shepherd, you have to protect your flock, make sure it thrives, steer in the right direction, and possibly go running after that one stray sheep which is headed for the wolf's den.

Many find this job rewarding but it is far from coding. Many managers I've spoken to that used to be coders talk about the simpler times when they enjoyed "just coding". Some others talked to me about how they code as a hobby now, not as a job and it's not only more enjoyable but it enables them more input on what goes on in their team.

This career path can lead to bigger and better things as you become a manager of managers, a directory, vice-president, or a CTO (Chief Technology Officer).
