When you first enter the web development field, it will be tempting to "get what you can" and screw anything and everything in the way but somewhere along the way, you're going to be concerned with more than just pay and technology.

One thing I often hear developers concerned with is ethics, and this is probably why most developers cite that job satisfaction hinges on "doing something bigger" and being part of a company "that can make a difference". It's why there is constantly discussion about "disruption" and making the world a better place.

It's at that point where ethics come into play. Many developers ask themselves the same questions any other human being asks but they apply it to their job:

1. Is my job making a difference in the world?
2. Am I contributing to something I feel positive about or negative?
3. If I could switch jobs but keep the same benefits, would I? And what would I do it for?
4. When I work on a project, do I feel positively or negatively about its impact on the world?

It may sound very hippie but these questions are important to ask. In the words of a close friend of mine, "Despite the money, it's not worth it."

Ethics and love for job are not necessarily linked but they can be.

###As a developer, you have a great deal of power

It may not seem like it but because the development market is a small pool while the demand is enormous, developers have a great deal of power when it comes to choosing a profession and making an impact on where you work.

In a realty analogy, it's a sellers' market and you're the seller of development services. That means you dictate who gets your services, for how much, and what you do with them. It's, obviously, not that simple but you get a lot of say in your line of work.

And remember that as a developer, you're usually the profit machine. Meaning that a company you work for will rely on your services to help make money. In many instances, your specific skills and efforts can translate to ensuring your employer makes several times over what you're paid. In fact, some figures state that in most extreme instance, your development work can translate to several thousand times over your salary (don't get your hopes up, it's not that common). However, still, unlike many "necessary evils" of having a company, development is the money driver.

For tech companies, this goes double. What does all this mean? Where you spend your time and your effort makes a difference. If you choose to go with unethical sleaze bags that you hate working for, you're not just sabotaging your personal happiness and possibly your career, you're contributing and making that company profitable at your expense.

Being a good or a great developer makes a bigger difference as well. If someone else will fill the position, fine, then they can have a potentially worse developer. If they get a good developer anyways, then at least you have the chance to make a difference elsewhere.

### Loving what you do makes a difference

Being ethically conflicted will make a big impact on your job performance. I've worked with several people that felt that way and any time the company introduced a new way to go around the rules or get better at what they do, there would be an internal groan amongst the entire team.

And that groan would translate into discussions about the company and finally, turn into jokes about what we tell ourselves to sleep at night. This can be demoralizing and can visibly impact how we do what we do. The only thing that kept all of us afloat was the technology and our free range with it. However, such an environment is not guaranteed everywhere and thus ethical concerns can hamper productivity very much.

I've had a developer friend who worked for a company he hated before he switched positions. He was ready to abandon development altogether until he started working elsewhere and rediscovered the joy of development.

If your beliefs and values don't align with the company, your hapiness and productivity will plummet.

###It's not often talked about

It really isn't. Developers love to talk about money and technology but ethics and morality can become a buzzing background thought. Well, unless it deals directly with the technology we work with such as when internet rights are threatened, or open source software is threatened. But it's a discussion worth having.

Even blogs and articles brush over this information. Mostly, there is talk about the good things:

1. Startups that are doing the most eco-friendly things in the world.
2. Kickstarters that hope to solve the world's problems.
3. Big companies that are suddenly taking interest in making the world a better place.

However, everything else is too bound up in politics, religion, and other taboo topics that most developers don't want to engage in. The difficult topics end up being discussed outside of the tech sector.

So make sure to talk to, at least, yourself about what you're doing and where you work.
