title: Legacy Software and Technical Debt

The idea of technical debt is tightly coupled with legacy software and both are concepts that are important to developers that want to advance in their field. Dealing with and masterly using both concepts can help create applications with extended longevity.

## Technical Debt

Technical debt can best be described in terms of actual debt and investment. Debt comes from taking out money that you promise to pay back one day. The reason for taking that money out can be any, from paying off bills to covering unexpected expenses, to getting principal for investment.

In a sample scenario, let's say that a person, Susan, borrowed $500 to pay her bills. She'll pay back her debt over the next several months. She did that because not paying her bills could put her in a much worse situation, like have her electricity or water turned off. She pays an interest on what she borrowed. The reason she could not pay her bills, in this situation, will be bad budgetting. If she keeps this up, she'll have to borrow more and more until debt will overwhelm her. If she fixes her budgetting issues, she'll be debt-free within a few months at little extra cost (the interest).

What we're describing in the scenario is normal debt usage. You borrow money to cover an expense that you did not have money for due to bad budgetting (or bad management/project management), and pay it back over time. If you keep up the bad budgetting, you'll get to a place where you can't pay the debt.

In another scenario, Susan paid off her debt; however, her car broke down so she borrowed $500 to fix it. Because of her new budgetting expertise, she was able to pay it off within a few months at little extra cost.

Such debt is useful then because it staves off a worse situation by applying a quick-fix to an unexpected situation. It also means that Susan had to realign her existing budget to pay off that debt despite the fact that she had done no wrong of her own.

In our last scenario, Susan borrows $500 to get a new car part. She did so because the new car part will not only make her car run faster and smoother, but it will also keep her gas expenses lower. If her old car part broke down, she knew that it would damage other parts of the car which would mean the repair would far exceed the debt. Thus, she invested the $500 into her car in order to save money in the long-term. She still had to adjust her budget to pay off the debt but after she paid it off, she found herself having extra money every month from her savings. On top of that, she got to work a little faster each day because driving more than 60 on a 65 used to rattle her car, but now, she can easily ride the speed limit.

This is investment debt. It's a debt purposely taken out to
