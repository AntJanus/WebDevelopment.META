It's easy to be a good developer. You get your job done, your code works, it passes tests (if you have any). And you find yourself happy where you're at. Good for you, you've just achieved career satisfaction. Something many people are not able to do.

But contrary to popular belief, it's easy to be a "good developer" but difficult to be a "better" developer. Inb4 rockstart developers, that's not what I'm talking about. I'm talking about being a developer that's able to write code very well, well enough in fact that anyone can jump in and take over. That kind of developer pushes for better testing practices, for well architected system, looks beyond just a quick solution but a solution with longevity, can accurately estimate technical debt, and can argue with a manager for all these things. Shortly, this developer is a more responsible professional that tends to become a Senior developer and more.

I have a whole load to say about this topic so there's an entire section on this.

Who is this section for:

1. a developer that wants to become better.
2. a better developer seeking validation.
3. a developer that wants to learn beyond what they currently know.
4. new developers wanting to learn some more advanced concepts regarding their job and skill.
5. someone wanting to set new goals and thinker deeper on their career.
