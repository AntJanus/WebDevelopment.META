title: Languages to Learn
----
content:

I wanted to have a fun little chapter so this one's it. I'd like to discuss the languages that are good to learn not just because of their usage but also because of what they can teach you along the way. Generally speaking, I'd stick to the languages I introduced in Section II Learning; however, there are times when it's definitely worthwhile to venture out and learn something new. Whether it's a new programming paradigm associated with a programming language or it simply introduces a different way of thinking, it's definitely worth learning more.

Without further ado, let's discuss when there is to be learned.

## Another Web Dev language

So I wanted to tackle this first. You might be thinking, "But I already know Ruby, why would I want to learn PHP?" Good question. Let's go over the learning advantages one can gain from getting venturing into the land of competition.

### Ruby

First there is Ruby. Ruby is interesting in the way its dependencies are setup. For instance, one can lock down not just a Gem they need for the application but also a Ruby version. Using rbenv or RVM, one can switch Ruby versions on the fly.

Another interesting aspect of Ruby is that it's a "spec language", meaning that there is a spec written as to how the language operates. This resulted in several ports of the language like JRuby (Java version), Iron Ruby (the .NET version), and its regular version.

There are also less objective reasons to learn Ruby:

- Beautiful syntax.
- VERY tight community of developers that support each other.
- Integration with UNIX makes it a prime suspect for command line tools or tools that work with the OS directly
- there are TONS of wonderful projects that run it (like Capistrano and Vagrant)

### PHP

Next, there is PHP, the age-old rival. PHP is rapidly reinventing itself and probably the coolest part about it is the fact that it's becoming super robust. Especially in its class-systems. PHP is a wonderful way to enter the OOP world with its C-like syntax and full-range of capabilities.

There's also the fact that PHP runs the popular Wordpress CMS so learning it is a great way to introduce yourself to the most popular Blogging/CMS platform in the world.

My less objective reasons for learning PHP:

-

### Javascript

Not only is it the only front-end programming language but it's an interesting back-end language. Javascript is by far the best way for a web developer to learn functional programming, prototypical programming, and about streams. Those three aspects of JS make it a prime candidate to get to the bleeding-edge by learning age-old accepted methods (streaming is a necessary part of Unix systems yet it has *just* made its way to back-end/front-end programming).

These three things will change your outlook on everything. JS is also all about ASYNC operations, and event-driven programming. As you can see, wherever you use it, you'll encounter a new paradigm to work with.

Outside of that, JS is rapidly becoming a "write once, run everywhere" language, more so than Java, and thus you can use it to power Arduino, your browser, desktop apps, servers, or command-line utilities.

### Python

I've already discussed Python as a back-end development language that originated as a multi-purpose language. It's important to note that Python is used for a number of command line utilities, and in fact, a lot of software supports Python-based plugins. For instance, Blender (a 3D rendering engine), Sublime Text (code editor), and VIM support Python plugins.

What's great about Python is its procedural programming application as those plugins. With a few lines of code, you can achieve a lot of power.

### C\#

C\# is sometimes called the "C++ for the web". It's true in some way and false in others; however, learning it can bring in a lot of insight as to why developers chose to go with C\# despite its platform limiations, and why some developers hate it. Most of the time, C\# is hated by people who hate Microsoft but outside of that, C\# is a wonderful language.

It's a language that works mostly OO with the ASP.NET MVC framework or as procedural using ASP.NET WebPages. Both of them are ripe candidates to learn this very mature language.

C\# is also statically typed and that's definitely worth getting into.

## C++

C++ is a multi-use language, one that can be used for just about anything. In fact, the OS you're running right now is written in it, so is your browser, your hardware drivers, PHP's engine, and much more. In fact, it runs most of the world's applications.

The best part about learning C++ is reinventing the wheel. C++ is as low-level as most developers get since beyond that is only C, Assembly, and machine language and due to the nature of Compilers, there's no reason to go lower level than C++ (in 99.9% of cases). Learning C++ can teach you about the fundamentals of Computer Science from using efficient algorithms (that are already implemented in most other languages), to building your own data structures.

The coolest part of C++ is just how much it's used today, and everywhere. You can use it to write video games (the Unreal engine, in fact, uses C++) or command line utilities. It's definitely worth learning as an OOP language as well. It's complicated but VERY powerful. It can imbue a sense of responsibility when writing it but it can give you an appreciation for all of the work done on higher-level languages in order to make them easier to use at the penalty of speed.

## Haskell

Haskell is an academic programming language that entered the mainstream. It's touted as the language that you learn and it'll change your life. It's a purely functional language meaning that it enforces even the most rigid functional paradigm rules like immutability (inability to change variables after they're set).

I haven't heard of any other language talked about as much and it forces you to think in terms of recursion and function chaining.

## Java

Java is another multi-purpose language. It's similar to C# but it's actually cross-platform. The great thing about learning Java is understanding why enterprise software is written in Java. It becomes quickly apparent that it enforces a certain amount of decoupling, so much, in fact, that large teams of people that can work on the project all at once without interfering with each other.

## Shell

Shell is the language of the command line. It's used to write "bash scripts" which are able to run various commands as if they were typed in one by one. Learning bash is great because it helps you understand how to operate Linux and Unix-like systems. Not only that, but Shell helps you operate faster in the command line.

But what about everything else? Shell uses streams and is efficient at it because Unix uses streams. With some learning, it can help you learn how chaining numerous very simple commands can produce an indistinguishable output. For instance, Shell can in one command bring up a list of running processes, select only those that have a search term in it, organize them alphabetically, and save them. Yet all it employs is: search, sort, and save. Combinging that with other some other commands, you can create something exponentially more complex just by chaining simple commands together.

## Others

There are many others worth looking into like R (for mathematical programming), Go, Objective-C (to make OSX and iOS apps), and so on. But it all depends on your secondary focus. Learning Java and Objective-C can help you get into mobile app development while C++, C\#, and Python can help you get into game programming. Javascript is starting to take over the world so if you don't know it by now, it's a wonderful addition.

If you've worked with startup-y languages (JS, Ruby, and even PHP), it's definitely fun to try out the enterprise-y, statically-typed, compiled alternatives (Java, C\#). If you want to learn about general computing and computer science, C++ is the way to go. For more utilitarian applications, Shell and Python can help you out.

If you want to learn purely programming paradigms, I'd suggest JS (despite it not being pure "anything), Haskell, and C++ or Java for OOP.

Every language has its place.
