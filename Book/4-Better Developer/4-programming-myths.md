title: Programming Myths

content:

Programming myths permeate the developer world as much as urban myths spread through high school. The non-tech media believes it whole-heartedly, young developers suspect something but stay in denial, and older developers know better, most of the time, until they start a whole new myth that serves them. Or a combination of the reactions may explain how you feel about them.

I wanted to dispell some of the myths and discuss what they really mean rather than what they have come to mean.

## The 10x

The 10x-er is a developer with such great knowledge that they can accomplish the work of 10 other developers of similar stature. It's a completely false idea but it's something media likes to write about. Mainly because we all like super heroes and a 10x engineer is a superhero/myth/legend among developers.

The reason why it's a myth is two-fold. One of them is the fallacy that's often attributed to project managers.

> Nine women can't make a baby in a month.

And the same goes for web developers, a real 10xer can't replace 10 developers. You simply can't assign 400 hours of work for a developer to figure out within a week. It doesn't work that way. To take the myth down a notch, let's think about a great developers. A great developer can save a lot of time with their current knowledge, coding standards, and some ingenuity. These elements should be part of every senior developer's box of tools. However, the perceived difference between a bad developer and a great one can make that great one look like a 10xer. On top of that having a team of developers fosters peer review, brainstorming, support and much more while a single developer can't do that for themselves. So, in short: you can't replace an entire team with a single person.

On the flip side, a single developer with the means and ability can write programs that replace 10 people easily, but that's not what the myth means though it's a much better definition.

The second reason the 10xer is a fallacy is associated with why this myth came about in the first place. I recently read a fun discussion about 10xers and how one developer was able to come into a long, drawn-out project that's been going on for several years and within a single month, turn it around, finish it, and make it better. At first glance, this developer could be credited with doing 3 years worth of work in a single month, and doing the work of 15 developers. That's definitely more than a 10x, that's a XXXxer. Truly incredible.

However, again, it's a fallacy. The reason why projects stall or become drawn out are rarely the fault of developers, let alone an entire team. Mismanagement, corporate inefficiencies, and office politics can make a simple project into a nightmare. From scope change, to unresponsive co-workers, other projects getting in the way, and the pace of technology, there are hundreds of potential hurdles to get through. Ones that PMs and managers are usually responsible for handling and even they sometimes can't handle all of it. Such hurdles can stretch a 3-month project into development hell that goes on for years.

When finally an outsider is hired at a terribly high rate and presented with a specific spec, the game changes. Scope change now requires new contracts, office politics had to have been settled by now, approvals have to be timely or already done by this point. Any delays or mistakes cost real-time additional money (not just fixed budgetted-for salaries). The developer also has a clean slate at this point, no more legacy software to deal with. Suddenly, the project is free of all of these hurdles and can easily be fulfilled. And voila, an outside contractor suddenly accomplishes more than the entire company could together.
