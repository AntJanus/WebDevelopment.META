title: Preventing Burnout

content:

Burning out is an issue that all developers face. And younger developers are often not aware of. To put it simply, a burnout is a state where one is overly fatigued by continued over-exertion. A burnout, left untreated, can result in terrible consequences.

This doesn't stop from managers pushing, however, nor does it stop developers from continuously working away through a burnout.

## What is it?

The simple definition can stand on its own but let's explore the topic further. Where does it come from? How long does it last? Well, every developer has their own amount of resistance to a burnout but everyone is susceptible to it even those that don't think they do.

There are some symptoms that accompany a burnout:

1. continued fatigue. When you start the day the next day, you still feel tired mentally.
2. inability to focus on a task. You may be trying to program one thing but you can't seem to understand exactly what you're trying to do so you have reread instructions several times.
3. inability to do simple tasks. Given an easy programming task, you struggle to accomplish it via normal means and end up making a lot of mistakes.
4. physical symptoms such as muscle tension, headaches, itching/burning eyes.
5. irritability.
6. many tasks you're presented with feel either a waste of time and dull or extremely overwhelming
7. you have a grim outlook on your day.

It can be soul crushing to keep running through a burnout. There are developers that "run on fumes" for years without any kind of reprieve and that can express itself in further health problems, it will kill your happiness, and it will kill your development productivity very quickly to an all-time low. And I'm not being overly dramatic here either. I've worked with developers that nearly quit their careers over burnouts that they thought was general unhappiness with the field. After they were able to reach a normal state of being, they realized they loved what they did and had a renewed sense of energy about them.

I know for myself that I often reach the point of a burnout but have learned to curb that situation.

## The Cause

Before I get into remedies and preventions, let's discuss a cause for burnouts. The cause is in its definition, basically overexerting yourself without taking a break to recharge; however, as simple as it sounds, most of us don't internalize it. There are still young developers on forums that seem to think they're invincible. And by young, I mean junior, not age-wise.

There are some common causes that I'd like to explore with you.

Working long hours. Contrary to popular belief, working longer hours does not necessarily get you faster results. In fact, the longer you work, the more likely you are to make mistakes, degrade the quality of your code, and create problems. Even the popular eight hour work day is seemingly not the best approach to work. Sweden recently put seven hour days on trial with much success. However, that may not be an option for you. The important thing is to balance out your day and not work more than your allotted eight unless it's an emergency.

This means that, no more weekend work, no more "staying after five" or whenever, and no more working late at night at home just to get a project done on a deadline. But if you do need to work longer hours it should happen rarely and not be a habit. On top of that, it should be followed by a time of less stress and responsibility. Meaning that once you launch that long difficult project, take a break.
