Lastly, as far as employment goes, I wanted to discuss social media and the like. Mainly as a resource for getting a job and long-term healthy employment. There's also portfolio making which is a necessary addition to a resume.

## Portfolio

A portfolio is traditionally an organized presentation of one's work and work accomplishments. In the case of a web developer, it can be anything from web design, to code projects, to open source libraries, and everything else. What's important about a portfolio is an ability to back up the words on your resume with some tangible evidence of your skill.

For a successful portfolio, you need to make sure of a few things:

1. Include ONLY your best work. Nothing mediocre. Keep the number of pieces small enough to be easily digestible but large enough to show your best.
2. Try to include varied pieces. Showing five of your web designs where each is in the less style is less helpful than one web design combined with back-end work and an app you created.
3. It's fine to do work directly for the portfolio. One such case for designers is "unsolicited redesign", or a design concept of an existing product/app/website that was not commissioned by that entity.
4. Use work that you're only approved to use. Don't try to use work that you are not allowed to disclose.
5. Make your portfolio online-accessible. Better yet, make your website a way to show off your best stuff.

Making a portfolio can be a difficult process in the beginning but as you go on, it'll become easier and more important. Many companies, fortunately, understand that not every job you take on will yield a portfolio piece and thus many developer interviewers try to discuss the technology and challenges behind a project that may not necessarily give you a nice "screenshot".

In this case, you would list those under "projects" on your resume. Your portfolio can contain anything visually appealing, or any code that you may have on hand (preferably on Github or similar), or any application you build. If you do create an app, make sure it's mostly bug-free. No reason for someone to visit your top project if they can't even see the page.

As far as posting code online. This is a pretty standard practice with the rise of Github. Github is like the social network of code developers where you post your projects and have people comment on it, use it, and even contribute. If you have some useful code, post it. For portfolio-purposes, a Github account is very much capable of demonstrating what you're capable of. Post pet projects in various languages to demonstrate your skill.

Also, keep in mind that your portfolio is a living thing so update it!

## Social Media

Social media, strangely enough, is a great way to socialize with other developers and gain a lot from it, not just a potential job. I thoroughly recommend Twitter and Reddit. Both of which are great ways to showcase your existing projects from Github and thus get feedback (plus, if you drop a line about looking for a job in the readme, you might get some responses!). They're both also great for learning about your skillset and becoming a part of the developer community.

It's difficult to describe the benefits other than just the community and a place to disemminate your blog articles and showcase your work. Both of which may lead to potential employment. Outside of that though, you may find some cool stuff like other people's work that may inspire you, various cool apps and libraries you might want to use, discussions on the job of a web developer and so much more. The community can quickly become a huge part of who you are and what you do.

If you have a question, feel free to ask and hopefully get good responses. There are several communities specifically geared toward CS careers (computer science) which can help you with your resume, with where to look and everything else.

One last thing, a potential employer may look through your twitter history. This can be a good and a bad thing. I've had an employer go through my reddit history out of curiosity and that fostered an instant connection between him and I since I did the same with his account.
