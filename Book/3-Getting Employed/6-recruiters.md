Because of the complicated nature of recruiters, they warrant their own chapter. Recruiters are the middlemen (and middlewomen) that act as liasons between a company and a prospective candidate. They try to make a deal between the two parties and get paid upon employment (or within 90 days after employment, the terms vary).

However, dealing with recruiters is a tad more complicated than dealing with an employer since they're a 3rd party which has its own interests.

## Recruiter types

### Company-side recruiter

There are several types of recruiters, let's first talk about a company-side recruiter, a recruiter that is employed by a company that is looking for new hires.

Such a recruiter may post listings in the company's name, relay information, salary rates, discard candidates, and pass candidates on to the hiring manager in a company. The recruiter may have a pre-interview with you to gauge your skills before recommending you further.

These recruiters try to find the best fit possible to help keep continuing business.

### Candidate-side recruiter

These are recruiters that look for candidates to match up to a list of jobs they have available. Many recruiters work for recruiting companies which means that they have a multitude of contracts to fulfill. Thus, they will look for people to generally match to a position.

This means that a recruiter may contact you about one position but find others that you may be suitable for. They are still obliged to find a company a good candidate, just like a company-side recruiter but they rest somewhere in the middle, looking for people generally to match to any position they need to fill rather than a single one.

I've also had some recruiters represent me to companies they were not necessarily under contract with but rather the company had already posted a listing that they are looking for an employee. It's not common but it's there.

## The Pros

Using recruiters has its benefits that can launch you into the correct path in your career. There is a reason why there are so many and why it's a booming field. It's difficult to find the right people, and it's difficult to find the right employer. Recruiters also take on other roles that an employer may not want to be responsible for such as doing background checks.

So here are the top reasons why you *should* choose a recruiter:

1. Skilled and senior recruiters are often on first-name basis with hiring managers in larger other companies. This gives their words and candidates more weight than a candidate that applied directly.
2. When one job falls through, a recruiter can line you up with several others right away.
3. A recruiter may offer better advice on job matters.
4. A recruiter may be your only way to contact a company so rather than pass on the job, work with the recruiter.
5. A recruiter will be able to better gauge your skills and can recommend better fits for a job.
6. Recruiters always have better and faster access to jobs, even those not listed.

I've heard other developers tell me constantly that recruiters are worth it. They can even argue on your behalf for a higher pay. It's like having another entity that fights with you.

Unfortunately, using a recruiter has its detriments as well.

## Cons

Using a recruiter has its downsides. Enough in fact that some people choose to never go with them. I am among them and for some good reasons. Not only are there numerous upsides to going to companies directly but having a third party involved in such a delicate process as securing a job can be hazardous.

The cons can't be bullet-summarized like the pros because they mostly apply to people themselves and not recruiters in general. As a third party, they have their own interests and some people take it way too far. What I *can* summarize is this:

1. You're always relying on a third party to communicate for you. A busy third party means that communication is not timely.
2. Your dealings with a prospective employer hinge on an extra person in the line to the hiring manager. That adds space for error and miscommunication.
3. Some people take their own third-party interests too far at your own detriment.
4. The third-party is human, entirely capable of the full-range of human behavior from helpful to malicious.
5. Recruiters may try to match you up with a better fit for a job; however, they will mostly focus on the positions to be filled by their company's contract obligations.

Number 4 is the real deal. I've personally met recruiters that were very helpful, even inspiring, and wonderful at all their tasks. From estimating a good salary range, to helping me with my resume, and finally to getting me the best positions on the market. I rarely find a satisfactory fit through a recruiter; however, there are recruiters who really do their best.

On the other hand are the nightmare scenarios that almost every seasoned developer has had to deal with. Those are the things to look out for.

One instance that seems to repeat itself over and over is the "bait and switch" process where a recruiter will cold-email you or post a position that you do not qualify for. When you start the talks and get excited, the recruiter will inform you someone else got it and try to sell you on a job they REALLY need filled and that you may be overqualified for. This would mean a badass fit for the company, for the recruiter, but maybe not the best fit for you.

Another story I hear often is recruiters lying about benefits and the environment you would work in. In this instance, they add on promises and "maybes" on top of the job listings in order to entice prospects to apply. This may apply to salary ranges (for instance, offer 60-80K when in reality the budget is 50K-65K and thus you will never reach beyond the real budget range), informal benefits ("flexible schedule" suddenly becomes very ridig), and similar.

At first glance, this doesn't make sense since there is no reason to try to deceive during the job finding process. A recruiter would be sabotaging themselves since you could refurse an offer and walk away as soon as you see through the deception; however, that is not always the case. The details may come out after you've already been hired at which point going back to job-hunting may be too much of hassle. Or you may enjoy the job and when you find out several of the benefits don't exist, you don't find it a reason enough to quit. The list goes on but it basically relies on the prospects' unwillingness to walk away.

## Should you do it?

That's up to you, as everything else. First hand experience is definitely the best way to learn. Hearing what others say on the topic is also useful; however, everyone will give you their opinion. I'm 100% sure that several developers will roll their eyes at reading my "cons" list but that's fine, they have their experiences. And you will have yours.
