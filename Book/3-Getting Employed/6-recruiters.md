Because of the complicated nature of recruiters, they warrant their own chapter. Recruiters are the middlemen (or middlewomen) that act as liasons between a company and a prospective candidate. They try to make a deal between the two parties and get paid upon employment (or within 90 days after employment, the terms vary).

However, dealing with recruiters is a tad more complicated than dealing with an employer since they're a 3rd party which has its own interests.

## Recruiter types

### Company-side recruiter

There are several types of recruiters, let's first talk about a company-side recruiter, a recruiter that is employed by a company that is looking for new hires.

Such a recruiter may post listings in the company's name, relay information, salary rates, discard candidates, and pass candidates on to the hiring manager in a company. The recruiter may have a pre-interview with you to gauge your skills before recommending you further.

These recruiters try to find the best fit possible to help keep continuing business.

### Candidate-side recruiter

These are recruiters that look for candidates to match up to a list of jobs they have available. Many recruiters work for recruiting companies which means that they have a multitude of contracts to fulfill. Thus, they will look for people to generally match to a position.

This means that a recruiter may contact you about one position but find others that you may be suitable for. They are still obliged to find a company a good candidate, just like a company-side recruiter but they rest somewhere in the middle, looking for people generally to match to any position they need to fill rather than a single one.

I've also had some recruiters represent me to companies they were not necessarily under contract with but rather the company had already posted a listing that they are looking for an employee.
