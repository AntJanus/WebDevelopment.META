title: Your First Job
---
content:

At some point, you will have to make the decision to go job hunting. Whether it's when you're getting out of college or after you've completed several courses and built a few sites. The decision is yours and it's hard to find the *right* time to start looking and considering work.

There are some things to consider first and some things to get right in order to find a good first fit and launch your career:

1. No one takes on a full-time employee without prior experience.
2. You maybe working your first job for only a year.
3. This is not about finding an "internship" but rather finding an enriching workplace.
4. The pay will still be higher than most other entry-level jobs.

Let's discuss the paradox of "no job without experience first". Initially, it seems like a scam. I mean, how can you get work experience if no one will hire without prior work experience? The trick is simple: you create work experience in a non-full-time environment. This hiring process makes complete sense because initial work experience gets a developer vetted to work alongside others, to pick up some initial communication skills in a company, and prove their ability to work in such an environment. Doing so gives companies an ability to cut down on the risk of hiring a junior developer that is unable to fulfill their duties and can become an obstruction to their regular workflow.

So how do you get around it? Several ways. I always recommend developer students and would-be programmers to focus on Freelance work. Freelancing teaches developers some amazing skills including aforementioned project management, communications with clients, and managing stray problems that don't have cookie cutter solutions. Telling a prospective employer that you've been freelancing for a year is much better than telling them you've been working on personal projects, trust me. There is much more to freelancing than that and you may be able to find a contracting job with an agency but we'll discuss that in a future chapter.

However, despite all of the work you'll put in to find your first job, you may be there for up to a year, probably not longer. The reason for that is that once you "get in", you'll start to rapidly climb, especially if you really dedicate yourself to expanding your skills. And by that, I don't mean spending 40+hours a week trying to study up on everything, by that I mean "sponging in" everything you can from your first job and then move on and get rid of your "junior" title ASAP. Once you feel like you've outgrown your job, move on. Tech jobs aren't the same as jobs in other fields, there is a certain expectation to "move on" in the first several years until settling in a senior-enough position where you dictate your work better.

And that takes me to my point about internships. First of all, tech internships? Unless you're getting paid a regular normal "junior developer" wage and actually work with code, don't consider it. If it says "intern" in the job title, I'd be wary; however, there are some companies that use that monicker to identify junior developers so read through a job description. It's rare though.

Anyways, don't take on free work, especially not long term. And don't take on free work where you don't get any experience. Even a junior developer position should help you get better at what you do. If, as a Jr. Developer you spend all day getting coffee for other developers, it's not a worth job taking. Take a job where you feel like, "Hey, within a year, I'll be a way better developer!".

And finally, consider this. The tech industry is booming. I already supplied some of the metrics on average pay. Jr. Position can pay *very* well, better than senior positions in other fields. So even if you feel like you can do *better*, keep in mind that you're getting paid well and soon, you'll be paid even better.

## So what does an ideal job look like and what should I be doing?

For me personally, I stumbled onto a great deal with my first few jobs. Outside of some freelance work, I worked with a marketing agency right before hitting it big as a Lead Developer for another marketing agency. My job in both cases consistent mostly of creating Wordpress websites based on a PSD (a photoshop file) design that a designer supplied. There was nothing "junior" about it, I was thrown into hard work right away and it was awesome. So let me relay to you some things I've learned:

1. A job should be just a little out of your comfort zone. Do you know Wordpress "somewhat okay"? Great, jump into a Wordpress gig and learn along the way.
2. A job should teach. That means that working should make you better, not keep you at the same level as you were when you started it.
3. A job should pay well enough. My first job gave me a decent living wage. Actually, more than that.
4. A job shouldn't over-extend you. This means that if you took on that Wordpress gig, they should not give you 5 sites to make a week. I've seen places like that and they cause people to burn out quickly.

And as to what you should be doing:

1. Handling code every day. This doesn't mean all of that code will be launched into production but it should be handled.
2. Deal with debugging and refactoring.
3. Solving problems. Even if they're small.
4. Learning every day.
5. If you have a senior developer overseeing you, mentorship time should be there as well. A time to talk to the senior developer about how to get *better*.
6. Attending meetings where you may not have input but can watch and learn.

Good luck!
