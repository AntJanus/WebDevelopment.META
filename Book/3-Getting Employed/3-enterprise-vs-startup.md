title: Enterprise vs Startup

content:

Before I get into the nitty gritty of getting your resume right, I wanted to tackle some of the biggest difference between work environments. One of the biggest rifts in the industry is the difference between an Enterprise environment, such as corporations, and a Startup environment. They are almost fundamentally opposite with one group citing, "Break things, move fast" while the other focuses on small iterative updates.

The difference is far reaching, not only in salary expectations, but also in work environment, technology use, expectation of employment length, and much much more. It's so starkly different, in fact, that people often prefer to work in one or the other rather than mixing it up.

##Enterprise

Enterprise is a word that usually means "really big company". There are certain stereotypes applied to this type of company: strict dress codes, mean managers, a certain level of dysfunction, cubicles, and much more. And while some of those may apply still today, they are not as prevalent and there are other factors to consider.

Let's first discuss the technology.

### Tech

There are certain languages and types of technology that permeate the enterprise industry so much that the languages' abilities have become indistinguishable from enterprise itself. A good example is Java. Java is the more Enterprise-y language out there though why can be difficult to explain. ASP.NET and Microsoft technologies are also seen as the "enterprise solution" rather than anything else.

However, over the past few years, the stereotypes of enterprise technologies have started to wane away. Java is still prominent but more and more companies show up using NodeJS for instance. Walmart is a great example of that. They're very much into Node these days.

So why Java? Java is an object oriented language with a ton of libraries. It's also been around for a long time and if there is anything you should know about Enterprise, it's that they are very prone to sticking with a technology decision for much longer than they should. A great example is companies that still use Internet Explorer 6. Java saw a huge rise in the late 90s and every since then it became the default technology for big corporations.

Its object oriented aspect made it a good prospect for unit testing (though that did not come around until later), it was also low-level enough to handle most tasks you could throw at it but high-level enough that it wasn't C++. In fact, Java is C++ inspired but meant to be easier. It's very versatile.

Another thing big companies are a fan of is ASP.NET and .NET architecture altogether. C\#, which is the programming language of choice for .NET, is similar to Java though it builds on it. Corporations, believe it or not, prefer to pay for products. Payment usually means that there is support, and that the company which creates the product will continue existing. Both are important aspects of running a large company.

However, many companies today are switching as open source alternatives grow quickly and maintain as good of a support as commercial products. On top of that, open source products often move faster and can have better performance. So don't be surprised to see a big oil & gas company trying to find a Ruby developer.

### Work environment

Corporate work environment is less laid back and you probably won't find a beer fridge but what you will find is a more professional environment.
