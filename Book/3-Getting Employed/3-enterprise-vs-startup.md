Before I get into the nitty gritty of getting your resume right, I wanted to tackle some of the biggest difference between work environments. One of the biggest rifts in the industry is the difference between an Enterprise environment, such as corporations, and a Startup environment. They are almost fundamentally opposite with one group citing, "Break things, move fast" while the other focuses on small iterative updates.

The difference is far reaching, not only in salary expectations, but also in work environment, technology use, expectation of employment length, and much much more. It's so starkly different, in fact, that people often prefer to work in one or the other rather than mixing it up.

###Enterprise

Enterprise is a word that usually means "really big company". There are certain stereotypes applied to this type of company: strict dress codes, mean managers, a certain level of dysfunction, cubicles, and much more. And while some of those may apply still today, they are not as prevalent and there are other factors to consider.

Let's first discuss the technology.

####Tech

There are certain languages and types of technology that permeate the enterprise industry so much that the languages' abilities have become indistinguishable from enterprise itself. A good example is Java. Java is the more Enterprise-y language out there though why can be difficult to explain. ASP.NET and Microsoft technologies are also seen as the "enterprise solution" rather than anything else.

However, over the past few years, the stereotypes of enterprise technologies have started to wane away. Java is still prominent but more and more companies show up using NodeJS for instance. Walmart is a great example of that. They're very much into Node these days.

So why Java? Java is an object oriented language with a ton of libraries. It's also been around for a long time and if there is anything you should know about Enterprise, it's that they are very prone to sticking with a technology decision for much longer than they should. A great example is companies that still use Internet Explorer 6. Java saw a huge rise in the late 90s and every since then it became the default technology for big corporations.

Its object oriented aspect made it a good prospect for unit testing (though that did not come around until later), it was also low-level enough to handle most tasks you could throw at it but high-level enough that it wasn't C++. In fact, Java is C++ inspired but meant to be easier. It's very versatile.

Another thing big companies are a fan of is ASP.NET and .NET architecture altogether. C\#, which is the programming language of choice for .NET, is similar to Java though it builds on it. Corporations, believe it or not, prefer to pay for products. Payment usually means that there is support, and that the company which creates the product will continue existing. Both are important aspects of running a large company.

However, many companies today are switching as open source alternatives grow quickly and maintain as good of a support as commercial products. On top of that, open source products often move faster and can have better performance. So don't be surprised to see a big oil & gas company trying to find a Ruby developer.

Enterprise coding usually involves rigorous long-standing processes for code approval which can be difficult to swallow. With a persistent enough senior staff, code can get stuck in the approval process for a long time and may require several revisions just so that it fits the rest of the codebase as closely as possible. This can be draining.

####Work environment

Corporate work environment is less laid back and you probably won't find a beer fridge but what you will find is a more professional environment. This means that hours are more likely to be fixed and the same as everyone else's but that also means that overtime is less likely to happen. Many companies have specific regulations against it actually. There's also less chance of open harassment, better way to deal with difficult internal situations through HR, and most of all, you'll get benefits.

The best part of working enterprise is that you get what you sign up for. You go in, you do your work, you go home and you're done. Before any rash decisions to fire someone, a boss will usually go through a complicated reprimanding process which usually tips you off about your performance. Managers and supervisors usually have experience doing what they do so they become predictable.

Outside of that, dresscodes are usually a given, and no crazy changes happen instantly. There's always a certain flow with work and getting anything done, whether it's a good flow or a bad one. And finally, there *is* a higher chance of working in a cubicle but most companies are starting to transition to an open space floor plan, whether you like it or not.

####Pay and benefits

Suffice to say, enterprise work has its benefits. One of them is pay. Pay, of course, is malleable but if you live outside of the Bay area (California/Sillicon Valley), chances are that startups in your area won't be funded with several million dollars to spend. Luckily, Enterprise software engineers can earn good cash and even transition into management along the route. The cool thing about enterprise is that there's a higher chance of "moving up" in that department.

But back to money. Enterprise is known to be a better employer in terms of money. On top of that, they already have a payroll in place and a way to deal with taxes so that already eases any possible trouble. And then, you get benefits.

Now, it may not mean much at first but having fully-paid healthcare can be a big deal (especially now that it's legally mandated). A 401K can also not seem much but when you start thinking about retirement or even using your 401K to buy your first house, that can be a game changer.

There's usually more time off available as well.

Again, though, in my experience, overall, enterprise pays higher wages for senior developers than startups. However, and note this, they may not be as gracious toward junior-level employees so look out for that.

###Startups

A startup is usually a small company with 10 or less employees (though it can become larger as it matures). It may or may not be funded by an outside entity and it usually has one or more founders that will work alongside you. Unlike enterprise, startups have just entered the game which can be a positive or a negative.

####Tech

Startups are notorious for picking up the latest cutting edge technology. Mainly because that can be its edge over established competitors. A good example of that is old e-commerce websites that still require constant refreshing, several steps to complete a purchase, and slow response times while a startup trying to inch in on the field may feature a bolstering User Interface built on top of the latest javascript technology with a fast back-end to make sure every step of the way is as quick and seamless as possible.

For that reason and because of low initial investment costs, startups go with open source solutions, contrary to what enterprise does. With startups, you're more likely see the usage of Python with Django, Ruby on Rails, NodeJS, and sometimes PHP. There are some other language choices. On top of that, you'll see a proliferation of front-end frameworks such as Angular and EmberJS.

These decisions are a double-edged sword, however. Startups need to "move fast and break things" in order to get a product out as soon as possible. This however leads to something called "technical debt". In the case of choosing technology, this can mean betting on the wrong technology and getting stuck with something that doesn't get updated, a mistake that Enterprise tries to avoid at all costs.

Something else that is important to mention is that Startups rarely ever follow proper conventions so things like code reviews, using design pattern, and proper handling of problems/solutions can be entirely absent. Same goes with proper testing. Thus is the rule of "move fast, break things". It's okay to mess up the code base as long as you're trying to make the product better in the long run.

One more important thing to say about technology is that a startup can be a wonderful place of learning. Because of the small group size, you may be required to take on responsibilities out of your comfort zone whilst building that "arrow" shape of a skillset. On top of that, working with cutting edge technology helps you see how that technology forms, how its bugs come up and even resolving them.

Being one of the first few employees can shoot you into high-standing positions (like a CTO or Lead Developer); however, joining a startup too late will get you stuck.

### Work environment

Unlike Enterprise, Startups pride themselves on their "company culture" usually dotted with various strange benefits (like unlimited beer in the office), recreational activities (a ping pong table), and generally a more relax attitude toward work. Going from enterprise to a startup can be shocking even in the clothing department as startups don't ban shorts, or flip-flops, or even hawaiian shirts. Those things, as they say, are not important to the company.

Startups also pride themselves on flexible schedules, allowing employees to work remotely fully or part time, and giving emergency days off that can be "made up over the weekend" or whenever else. However, there will be busy times when employees are expected to work overtime without any extra pay or benefit simply because the startup requires it to succeed.

There's also the issue of not having proper HR setup which can either lead to a positive place: a place where jokes are not taken seriously and where people can speak their minds. Or a negative place: a place of abuse and harrassment which a CEO may not know how to deal with. The latter usually becomes the case as a startup starts to outgrow its infancy and at that point HR and rules become crucial.

However, expect a friendlier atmosphere and expect your co-workers to ask you to go out drinking outside of work!

### Pay and benefits

Startups are notorious for not knowing what they're doing with payroll and taxes. Some opt out of dealing with it and hire you as a contractor, stripping you of any healthcare benefits or otherwise while others may botch the process entirely and delay your payments. Healthcare and 401K are usually non-existent in the startup world; however, those benefits are replaced with the more esoteric ones that I've mentioned: free beer and entertainment.

As far as pay goes, startups range wildly. Heavily invested startups can offer above-market price while boostrapped (read: self-funded) startups may be more cautious with their money and hire under market value. Startups, however, are great for junior developers as they rarely require much background and pay well for the experience. An enterprise company may turn down a junior developer due to inexperience while a startup may hire them for having experience. It seems a little strange at first but it makes sense in the long run: startups are able to hire cheaply (by hiring rising junior developers) and hire developers that are eager to spend all of their time learning cutting edge new technology while enterprise wants to hire long-term reliable developers that are willing to stick with a Legacy (read as "old") system for a long while.

##So which one?

To be honest, I would pick neither. Startup culture has some great benefits but its detriments can put you off. Enterprise is the same way and though the pay can be rewarding, it can't make up for stricter schedules and legacy software troubles.

The best bet, in my opinion, is catching a startup that has just gotten into a good track and no longer needs outside funding. Those startups are usually sufficiently large to have everything figured out as far as payments and HR, and even benefits while still retaining some of its "relaxed" atmosphere. It's a hell to go through if you started before the reorganization but if you get hired during or right after, it can be a rewarding mix of enterprise and startup.

The other best bet is quite the opposite, an enterprise-sized company trying to either create a silo (a startup within the company), open a new software department to create a new system ratehr than support legacy, or one that has just purchased a startup and wants to expand it as a new department/wing/etc.
