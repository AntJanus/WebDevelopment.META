Freelancing is a method of working and getting paid similar to owning your own business. You're essentially responsible for your taxes, profit, getting clients, legalities such as writing contracts, and even saving up for time off. Freelancing can be very rewarding. Some relish in it, enjoying flexible hours, and having the ability to take on a variety of projects. It can also allow them to take on a major project and take an easy month or work harder and see that work pay off right away.

Unfortunately, for others, freelancing can be a hard trade with problems stemming from not enough clients and being punished for small mistakes since there is no bigger company to take on responsibility for those mistakes.

Contracting is similar to freelancing but instead of looking for clients and projects and up-keeping an online persona in order to find more business, one signs contracts with individual companies to work with them in an employee-like status for a period of several weeks to several months. It's sort of a middle-ground between freelancing and full-time work.

There is much to know about contracting and freelancing and the more you know, the more you'll be prepared against some of the common pitfalls when entering the field.

###Pitfalls

Freelancing and generally working for yourself is rewarding in its own ways but it's tricky. Here are some things to watch out for.

####Taxes.

Let me repeat, Taxes. TAXES. Taxes are the bane of freelancers and contractors alike. The reason is that you're solely responsible for putting aside taxes, and not just your regular income tax but "self-employment tax" on top of that. This is all for the US developers but if you're from anywhere else, you'll face the same issues.

Make sure to ALWAYS put aside enough money and not dip into it. I've met far too many developers that didn't save up enough to pay at the end of the quarter. That's right quarter. Freelance taxes are paid every 3 months. So don't forget!

####Time Off

While time off seems like a natural part of working, it's not so as a contractor or freelancer. A holiday means that you have another day you need to save up for in order to take it off. This means that holidays can become extra stressful.

So whenever you're calculating how much money you need, make sure to include days when you won't be working such as holidays, paid time off, vacations, and even sick days. It pays to make money ahead of time.

This still applies to contracting as well.

####Business downtime

This applies doubly for Freelancers. Business varies with time of the year. For example, December is a terrible month since most businesses want to shut their doors close and not accept new projects, this can become an issue for freelancers that depend on business-to-business work. It can be frustrating for contractors as well as they will have a difficult time finding work around that time.

On the other hand, the beginning of the year can an extraordinarily busy period during which freelancers can strike a number of deals as businesses and individuals alike seek new opportunitites and ventures. This works out for contractors as well, however, they won't benefit as much from the uptime of business since they can only hold one job at a time, unlike freelancers who can queue up business for several months.

Again, it pays to count your finances beforehand and figure out where to go.

####Not Having a contract

Contractors, obviously, usually operate under a contract provided by the employer (make sure to read through it carefully!) but freelancers have to make sure their clients will sign their contracts and follow through on them. It's common for freelancers to accept projects under nebulous terms and can easily succumb to litigation or not getting paid.

There's a famous talk on youtube that was the product of such repeated behavior called [Fuck you, pay me](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6h3RJhoqgK8) which discussed this specific issue. Contracts are there to keep a solid understanding and expectations between client and a freelancer. A contract is also the only proof of agreement about payment.

####Not reading a contract

The other issue is not reading your contract. This is important for contractors who may blindly sign one without as much as glancing at it, excited about a new opportunity. It may seem like, at first, that you're not trusting the other party and in truth, you shouldn't, but it has more to do with having clear understanding between two parties.

Here are some usual clauses to watch out for:

* Intellectual property - this has to do with whatever you create while working for a company. Some companies extend this clause to include anything you create in your *spare* time. Meaning that if you're slaving away all day, come home, and decide to build some small app for yourself, it's your employer's property.
* Payment options - some companies provide only specific types of payment (check, direct deposit, etc.) and may give themselves extraordinary amount of time to pay. For instance, a company may state that it will have up to 90 days to pay any invoice which can be problematic.
* Non-compete clause - this one is prominent among full-time salaried employees as well so watch out but a non-compete is basically an agreement that for some amount of time you may not work for any competition in the area after your contract is done. This can be devastating if the clause is overreaching such as when competition is described as any company using similar technology within a 50 mile radius, and for the duration of two years.
* cancellation and completion clauses - for the freelancers, make sure that if the client provides you with a contract of their own, it doesn't state something like, "we can cancel at any point and not pay for any work done so far while still retaining IP". These terrifying clauses popup often and can cost you your business.

The basic thing I can tell you is reading through a contract and never trust it when someone says that this is a "standard". Look it up first, ask other developers.

###Freelancing

Let's talk about freelancing. Freelancing can be wonderful but usually requires a solid base of clients in order to be an enjoyable venture. And just like finding a job, there are certain strategies to obtaining and retaining customers. There's also the issue of "how much to charge" which no one can quite agree on, and finally, it's important to understand all of your responsibilities. And interestingly, remember that web development can be more than just that in clients' eyes.

####Getting Clients

Getting clients is sometimes easier than retaining them but both are daunting tasks. The first place you want to make sure is ready is your own website that showcases your work, discusses the services you offer, and, hopefully quickly, can show off testimonials of past clients.

The second place depends on you. I personally found freelance work by writing articles about freelancing, about making websites, and interjecting a little note at the end that says I'm available for projects. It's not very effective.

Another place is Craigslist. Believe it or not, many smaller business depend on craigslist as a means of getting work done. And even larger businesses do. Check it out, their services or web work section and see if there is anyone looking for work done. Be wary of people that have the "next Facebook!" idea or people that offer a percentage of future profit as a payment. Outside of that, make sure you can get these clients to sign contracts, even if they claim to not "do things this way". A lost client is better than a non-paying client that costs you several thousand dollars worth of work.

There are plenty of other communities where people post projects and you can try to get in contact with the client and discuss it. Reddit is a good place. However, there are plenty of communities that just don't work well. There are many sites that are meant for developers such as ODesk and Freelancer but from my personal experience and the experiences that I've heard about it from many other developers, it's a pitfall of failure because of low-paying projects, high competition that underbids everyone, and sketchy client behavior.

Outside of that, there's always "cold emailing", or emailing business that look like they need a new website; though, I've never had any success with that particular one.

####How much to charge

This one ranges wildly from $20/hour to $150/hour depending on the type of the work you do. The rule of thumb is to pick a salary you'd like to make and work your way down from it:

1. Multiply the rate by a certain % to account for extra taxes
2. Add extra money for days off and holidays. Most companies have about 6-9 holidays a year plus 10-15 days off a year
3. Add expenses that will come out of your pocket. You'll need a computer, accounting software, billing, invoicing, web development software, probably some subscriptions, etc.
4. Savings for the time that you won't be able to find a project.
5. Expenses to find a client
6. And money to take into account when business speeds up or slows down.

This is why some companies and some individuals can reach very high rates. Some developers charge at least $10K per project, and each project can last anywhere from two weeks to a month.

####Responsibilities

As a freelancer, you'll have certain responsibilities, beyond that of taxes that you will have to make sure you take care of. If you don't, you might get in trouble and jeopardize your business:

1. project management - clients *can* get lazy even if they tell you how adamant they are about their deadline. It's up to you to keep up the flow of information and the steam of the project. If you need content, make sure you get it, and make sure to ask for it when necessary. If you need a client's approval to move on, make sure they know and make sure you let them know that if you can't get approval by a certain date, you will have to postpone the deadline.
2. invoicing - sending invoices (basically a piece of paper that says how much a client should pay you) is part of your job. So is following up on late clients, and possibly following up with whatever contractual obligations they have and whatever rights you have if they fail to pay on time.
3. timetable - it's up to you to figure out how much you can handle. If you find several clients at once, great! However, you may not be able to pay attention to that many projects at once. Taking them on could force you to either work VERY long hours (I've heard of developers pulling 80+ hours a week) or breaking the contract. On top of that, you're risking losing quality, losing possible repeat clients, and pay altogether. Make sure you know how much you can handle and only take on that amount.

There's much more than that, but you get the idea.

####Beyond WebDev

So when your client tells you they want a "website", it could mean one in a million different things. For a non-tech person, a website is a very nebulous term (which is why there are contracts that specify what a website is!) so make sure you know what you're getting yourself into. But also, know that you can't always avoid doing only one part of the overall job. It's easy to push off, for instance, design when you're the one doing web development; however, you may lose business this way.

Freelancing is the epitome of the "jack of all trades" so let's go over some things that clients will see as a website and may expect from you:

1. Design - Every freelance web developer I know has at least basics of design. This means that they can create a polished UI for a client's needs; however, it doesn't mean that you should have to be a UI design expert that can build the next generation communication web application for a watch.
2. Development - This one is a given but it also means front-end as well as back-end. There will be clients that will need one or the other, but some will want both, not knowing there is a difference! :) Make sure you know enough of both to build a solid website
3. SEO - or Search Engine Optimization is the black magic of making a website "pop" in the ranking of a search engine (basically, google). This is an effort worth an entire agency over the course of many months or even years so you can't possibly do this alone unless it's the only thing to do. You'll need to inform your client of that; however, there are things you *can* do as a developer: have clean markup, present all of your contents so that it's search engine legible, use the proper SEO tags (like using the correct `h1` for headings), and generate a sitemap without any dead pages (get rid of dead pages too). These few things won't put your client on the map but when they do approach an SEO company, the company won't have to make an extensive list of things that need to change on the back-end, development side.
4. IT/Hosting - many clients maybe unfamiliar with the concept of "hosting" a website. You may be called on to recommend a hosting company and to even setup your final product there. Make sure you familiarize yourself with website migrations, hosting, and linux for this task.
5. Error/Support - You may be thinking that once you're done with a site, you hand it off and don't have to think about it again but client's may not see things the same way. Every developer will create bugs that's why it's easier to say that clients pay you for time to build a website, not for the actual final product. Make sure you know how to debug, fix, and support your product.

It should go without saying that none of these tasks should be offered for free and if you're uncomfortable with any of them, you may want to state so and make it known; however, the fuller complete package you can offer, the better. It's also worth mentioning that any of these tasks requested by a client should be on the contract and discuss limits of performing them. This is what's called a "scope", a defined set of limits within a project or a contract. Expanding it should change the contract.

###Contracting

Now that we're a bit more familiar with freelancing, let's jump into the world of contracting which is similar yet so very different. It can be a rewarding career move for people that like change, that want to move around between technologies and jobs. However, with this freedom comes the responsibility of finding the next gig right away, figuring out your benefits, what to charge for and what to not charge for, and a great deal more so let's dive in.

####Finding the next gig

Contractors should have an easy time finding the next gig so this item is not so worrysome. Make sure, though, to have it aligned at least several weeks prior to the end of one contract. It's also not uncommon for companies to renew your contract continuously through the years. Some companies prefer this over full time hires or may have rules that prohibit full-time remote hires.

####Benefits

Most contracting gigs don't offer benefits; however, there are several alternatives to company-paid benefits. You can start your own 401K that you can contribute to yourself without the assistance of a company. And while you do lose on the "matching" amount a company would pay, you won't have to deal with rollovers and you'll be in full charge of it.

As far as medical care, there are plenty of options out there. If you choose to do so, you may find a job as a "full-time contractor", which is a position at a company that hires out people. Meaning that you keep a steady position with full benefits while you contract with the company's clients.

####Tracking your time

This bit can be confusing but as a contractor, even one that works "full-time" or 40 hours a week, you'll be required to submit a time tracking sheet. Depending on who you work for, it may even require justifications as to how you spent your time though I haven't encountered too many companies that do that. There are some things you may not be aware of. For instance, you can't track time you spend eating lunch. For all intents and purposes, it's an hour off. However, meetings, discussions with other employees regarding a project *can* be tracked. Even checking your email can be tracked.

Generally speaking, as long as you're devoting your time to work in one way or another, it can be tracked.

###What it all means

All kinds of things but one thing I can recommend for everyone is trying out Freelancing, no matter what. It's a great way to get initial experience when you're starting out or to get extra money on the side when you have a big purchase coming up. It's also a great path in the web development career; however, it's definitely not for everyone.

If you have an adventuruous spirit, freelancing is definitely a great journey and it can be a great way to build a startup.

As far as contracting goes, I recommend it for the jittery but it's not something you should or need to experience. It's just another way of doing things.
