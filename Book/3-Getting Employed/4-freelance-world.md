title: Freelancing and Contract
----
content:

Freelancing is a method of working and getting paid similar to owning your own business. You're essentially responsible for your taxes, profit, getting clients, legalities such as writing contracts, and even saving up for time off. Freelancing can be very rewarding. Some relish in it, enjoying flexible hours, and having the ability to take on a variety of projects. It can also allow them to take on a major project and take an easy month or work harder and see that work pay off right away.

Unfortunately, for others, freelancing can be a hard trade with problems stemming from not enough clients and being punished for small mistake since there is no bigger company to take on responsibility for those mistakes.

Contracting is similar to freelancing but instead of looking for clients and projects and up-keeping an online persona in order to find more business, one signs contracts with individual companies to work with them in an employee-like status for a period of several weeks to several months. It's sort of a middle-ground between freelancing and full-time work.

There is much to know about contracting and freelancing and the more you know, the more you'll be prepared against some of the common pitfalls when entering the field.

## Pitfalls

Freelancing and generally working for yourself is rewarding in its own ways but it's tricky. Here are some things to watch out for.

### Taxes.

Let me repeat, Taxes. TAXES. Taxes are the bane of freelancers and contractors alike. The reason is that you're solely responsible for putting aside taxes, and not just your regular income tax but "self-employment tax" on top of that, which is about 15%. This is all for the US developers, if you're from anywhere else, you'll face the same issues.

Make sure to ALWAYS put aside enough money and not dip into it. I've met far too many developers that didn't save up enough to pay at the end of the quarter. That's right quarter. Freelance taxes are paid every 3 months. So don't forget!

### Time Off

While time off seems like a natural part of working, it's not so as a contractor or freelancer. A holiday means that you have another day you need to save up for in order to take it off. This means that holidays can become extra stressful.

So whenever you're calculating how much money you need, make sure to include days when you won't be working such as holidays, paid time off, vacations, and even sick days. It pays to make money ahead of time.

This still applies to contractor.

### Business downtime

This applies doubly for Freelancers. Business varies with time of the year. For example, December is a terrible month since most businesses want to shut their doors close and not accept new projects, this can become an issue for freelancers that depend on business-to-business work. It can be frustrating for contractors as well as they will have a difficult time finding work around that time.

On the other hand, the beginning of the year can an extraordinarily busy period during which freelancers can strike a number of deals as businesses and individuals alike seek new opportunitites and ventures. This works out for contractors as well, however, they won't benefit as much from the uptime of business since they can only hold one job at a time, unlike freelancers who can queue up business for several months.

Again, it pays to count your finances beforehand and figure out where to go.

### Not Having a contract

Contractor, obviously, usually operate under a contract provided by the employer (make sure to read through it carefully!) but freelancers have to make sure their clients will sign their contracts and follow through on them. It's common for freelancers to accept projects under nebulous terms and can easily succumb to litigation or not getting paid.

There's a famous talk on youtube that was the product of such repeated behavior called "Fuck you, pay me" which discussed this specific issue. Contracts are there to keep a solid understanding and expectations between client and a freelancer. A contract is also the only proof of agreement about payment.

### Not reading a contract

The other issue is not reading your contract. This is important for contractors who may blindly sign one without as much as glancing at it, excited about a new opportunity. It may seem like, at first, that you're not trusting the other party and in truth, you shouldn't, but it has more to do with having clear understanding between two parties.

Here are some usual clauses to watch out for:

* Intellectual Property - this has to do with whatever you create while working for a company. Some companies extend this clause to include anything you create in your *spare* time. Meaning that if you're slaving away all day, come home, and decide to build some small app for yourself, it's your employers property.
* Payment options - some comapnies provide only specific types of payment (check, direct deposit, etc.) and may give themselves extraordinary amount of time to pay. For instance, a company may state that it will have up to 90 days to pay any invoice which can be problematic.
* Non-compete clause - this one is prominent among full-time salaried employees as well so watch out but a non-compete is basically an agreement that for some amount of time you may not work for any competition in the area after your contract is done. This can be devastating if the clause is overreaching such as when competition is described as any company using similar technology within a 50 mile radius, and for the duration of two years.
* cancellation and completion clauses - for the freelancers, make sure that if the client provides you with a contract of their own, it doesn't state something like, "we can cancel at any point and not pay for any work done so far while still retaining IP". These terrifying clauses popup often and can cost you your business.
