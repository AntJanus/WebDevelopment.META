title: Once you get it

I talked a lot about getting a job but not much about what to do once you get it. Your first job, or whichever actually, should always be a learning opportunity. You should never walk out of a job thinking that you're at the same place you were before you got there. Take from that what you will.

There are some ways to encourage your workplace to be a learning space as well so take note and jump on opportunities:

1. when a new technology is necessary for usage, volunteer to learn and use it.
2. if you get to decide about technology, make an informed decision but don't forget to challenge yourself.
3. if you're working with only one part of a larger application, dive into the code you don't always touch and try to learn from it. Ask yourself, what kind of architecture are the other developers using? What language/framework is this using and how does it work? Can you see any design patterns you've learned about?
4. if you're still using the same technology as before, always make sure to challenge your code. See if you can make it more performant, adhere to better practices, and/or better architected.
5. Larger developer teams often have senior staff that doesn't mind mentoring, see if you can find someone who will help you reach your next level.

Another thing to remember about your job is that your current job won't be your last job and you definitely should not feel bad about leaving. Work is work and you have to do what you can for your career so if you're stuck at a failing startup, you might need to make the decision to jump ship. On the other hand, if you're at a sucessful company but you're bored, find a better place. Things change over time and so do workplaces so if things aren't to your liking, go ahead and find something better.

It is true, however, that the longer you spend in the industry, the less likely you are to switch jobs. This is because over time, you'll find a better gauge as to what job will satisfy you the most. On top of that, the more seniority you have, the easier it is to find wiggle room for those learning opportunities. It also becomes a chore rather than an exciting adventure when you look for a job. I know for myself that I dread it when I used to be excited what kind of an amazing job I'd find next.

So, good luck!
