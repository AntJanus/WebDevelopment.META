title: Avenues to Employment

There are many types of jobs and many different ways to get them. As you get better and progress through your career, more avenues on both sides will open up. Before I get into the *how*, let's talk about what kind of jobs there are:

1. Salary
2. Contract
3. Freelance

The difference between the three is like night and day and it's important to know about it.

To summarize, a salary job is your regular "I'm getting paid XXk/year for my 40 hours a week" job. This means you have a stable job you attend at regular hours (usually 8-5 with an hour lunch break), regular time off on Holidays, and most likely paid time off or "sick time" depending on where you work. This is usually what people strive for.

Contract work is a little different. You may work 40 hours a week but you're working for a set amount of time (for example 6 months) that you agreed on with your employer. They pay for what you work so if you take a day off, subtract 8 hours from your hourly total and 8 hours worth of wages. There is no paid time off, no holidays off, and no benefits (\* usually. There are instances where a third-party company will provide benefits as part of the contract deal). There's also the added stress of managing your own taxes and finances. The added bonus is that you get paid much more and get to choose where that extra money goes (eg. your own benefits, savings for time off, etc.) and you get to write off certain expenses as part of your "business".

Freelance is similar to contract in the money aspect but rather than working for a company for 6 months, you get your own clients and work as a sole entrepreneur. This means that not only do you work as a developer, but you take on the role of a business negotiator, marketer and many others to find clients and get them to hire you to do a project. This avenue may be more difficult but it can be much more rewarding in terms of money or otherwise.

At first glance, the first option seems the best but it may not be for you. I'll dig into that further in a later chapter.

## Where to look for a job then?

There are countless ways to get a job. Anywhere from running into a senior developer at a bar to sending hundreds of resumes to any and all companies out there. However, both of those are inefficient. The chances of running into a software engineer that is currently hiring for someone with your skillset at a bar and being able to take advantage of it are miniscule. Similarly, Resume spamming will get you nowhere.

The top main ways of getting a job today are a little different than they used to be:

1. Directly contacting a company that is hiring. Tech companies often post openings on their website.
2. Responding to a posting on Monster.com, LinkedIn, or other similar job posting sites.
3. Contacting a recruiter that will match you up with jobs.

All of these so far are "seeker" methods, there are other more passive methods:

1. Attending tech meetups and meeting senior developers whose companies may be hiring.
2. Keeping a flag on your github/linkedin profile as "looking for a job".
3. Writing articles and blog posts on the topic of the job you're looking for and making sure your website includes hiring information.
4. Responding to recruiter spam.

These are more akin to the "passive" methods.

### The Seeker Methods

The seeker methods are basically different ways of pushing your resume into people's hands. I found that all three aforementioned methods are effective though every developer will tell you their horror stories and their success stories with each.

**Direct contact** Directly contacting a company has a bounty of benefits. One of them is that you're dealing directly with the company and no third party is invovled. Even with job postings, you're more likely to get in touch with a recruiting company rather than the employer themselves.

This is great because you can easily demonstrate your skills and use your social skills to get a foot in the door. On top of that, discussions about salary, about job environment, and about job duties will be more open. You're welcome to ask questions and receive responses right away. In this manner, it's also easier to figure out if you're the wrong fit or the company is the wrong fit for you.

Interestingly, direct contact positions are usually "passive employment", meaning that you'll most likely be competing against a small number of other developers since the company is most likely not aggresively trying to find someone.

There are SOME detractors, such as job listings being out of date, difficulty of finding companies that are hiring (this is VERY important to know), and most of all, it's the passivity may translate to casual interest in hiring you, this means that you may not get immediate responses or timely progression through the hiring process.

**Job posting sites** Job posting sites such as Monster.com, Indeed, and LinkedIn are great sites in terms of finding a job because they offer a great variety of jobs that will appeal to a number of your skills. If you're on the fence about going into UI development or just plain Javascript development, you can find jobs for both and understand your prospects for both.

It's also a great way to apply to many different companies and wait for feedback. Simply put: this is the easiest way to find a job. The positive part about this process is that if a company posts on one of these sites, it's almost guaranteed they want to fill that position ASAP. The problem is, there are a great many developers applying for jobs precisely this way, that means a lot of competition. On top of that, the top roles are hidden from you or immediately fulfilled.

Another issue is that many of these postings may be recruiter sponsored, meaning that a company hired a recruiting company and that company posted as the original prospective employer. This means that when you think you're talking to a representative of the employer, you're actually talking to a third party that may have its own intentions.

I definitely recommend this method as a backup for other methods, or as a way to find your first job.

**Contacting recruiters** Some job posting sites are actually sites made by recruiting companies. Or you may get in touch with a recruiter and talk to them about your opportunities. Due to the lucrative nature of the tech field, there is no shortage of willing recruiters.

The cool thing about recruiters is that they often know about "hidden" positions, these are job postings that companies don't necessarily advertise anywhere but there is an unspoken internal need for these positions. For instance, a Lead Developer position may not be posted on Monster.com but the hiring manager at company X may mention to a recruiter that they "should really get someone for this position".

Another good thing is that recruiters that repeatedly place employees at a company are more trusted to bring in good candidates. Getting submitted for a job by that recruiter will increase your chances of hire. They may also submit your resume (with your permission) to other companies the second positions come up. And due to their knowledge of the field, they may help you negotiate a better salary.

Now, there are some issues. If you've ever done anything major through a third party (like renting/buying a house), you'll know that the person who is seemingly helping you is working for themselves to get a good deal for themselves. There are stories of "bait and switch" (where recruiters offer a fantastic job, then tell you the position was closed and present you with a mediocre one they need filled ASAP), or pretty much the equivalent of "negging" where recruiters try to sell you on lesser positions while telling you that's all you can get in order to secure a quick hire or prevent you from looking for better positions that the recruiter does not have access to.

Dealing with recruiters is difficult so I will definitely talk about them a lot more down the road but keep in mind that as any method, there are upsides and downsides. The more you're aware of the downsides (and the upsides), the more you can take advantage of your situation.

### Passive Methods

The passive method is the equivalent of Inbound marketing vs Cold calling. Passive methods are meant to employ you by people that are really looking for someone like you. This eliminates the cruft of getting no responses on a resume or trying to get your foot into a company that doesn't want you.

**Meetups**

This one is a little new and does not apply to many other fields. Tech meetups are a pool of the best developers meeting together to exchange information. More often than not, these developers know of open positions. Recruiters also attend these meetings to find candidates.

At the meetup I go to, the presenters routinely mention that their employer is hiring for specific positions. At other meetups, it's simple to talk to the organizer and let them know you're looking and they can easily match you up to someone else who contacted them to let them know their company is looking. Hiring is expensive and difficult, and this is a great way to find a match.

The advantage is that really good developers attend these meetups and usually good developers will work for good companies. Also, if they recommend you for getting hired, that's almost an instant hire.

**Looking for a job flag**

This is a little bit of a given but when you're looking for a job, make sure that your Github or LinkedIn has a flag that says "looking for work". This is great for prospective recruiters, hiring managers, and even fellow contacts to know you're looking and to contact you. If you don't have a LinkedIn, make one now and add everyone you know or that can be beneficial to your connection list.

As far as Github, Github is like the social media/portfolio for developers but it's also a project maangement tool, and a development tool. It houses open source projects which can be used to showcase your work. In that way, they're also a demonstration of your skill.

Having useful open source projects, or popular open source projects, can help find jobs. On top of that, it's the first place fellow developers will check out when they want to find something out about you.

**Writing articles**

This one is a bit unorthodox and when I gave a talk about developer employment, I got some weird looks and later on was asked, "how can you even force yourself to do it?" and the thing is, I don't, I love it. Writing articles is by far my most interesting method of getting a good job. There have been numerous instances where I was able to seal the deal because my would-be bosses have read my work and actually learned from it.

On top of that, it's totally fine to shamelessly advertise yourself at the end of your posts. And the more people you get to read your post, the higher the chance that one of them will reach out to you or have their hiring manager reach out. It sounds impossible but I've worked in a company that reached out to a prospective employee based on a twitter conversation, and he got hired. I've been interviewed and my boss recalled an article I wrote a year prior and how he found it useful. It was a great "in".

Along with this there are other methods. People advertise jobs on Reddit, and I've seen very meaningful comments followed up with "Well, if you're looking in this area, give me a shout."
