title: Avenues to Employment

There are many types of jobs and many different ways to get them. As you get better and progress through your career, more avenues on both sides will open up. Before I get into the *how*, let's talk about what kind of jobs there are:

1. Salary
2. Contract
3. Freelance

The difference between the three is like night and day and it's important to know about it.

To summarize, a salary job is your regular "I'm getting paid XXk/year for my 40 hours a week" job. This means you have a stable job you attend at regular hours (usually 8-5 with an hour lunch break), regular time off on Holidays, and most likely paid time off or "sick time" depending on where you work. This is usually what people strive for.

Contract work is a little different. You may work 40 hours a week but you're working for a set amount of time (for example 6 months) that you agreed on with your employer. They pay for what you work so if you take a day off, subtract 8 hours from your hourly total and 8 hours worth of wages. There is no paid time off, no holidays off, and no benefits (\* usually. There are instances where a third-party company will provide benefits as part of the contract deal). There's also the added stress of managing your own taxes and finances. The added bonus is that you get paid much more and get to choose where that extra money goes (eg. your own benefits, savings for time off, etc.) and you get to write off certain expenses as part of your "business".

Freelance is similar to contract in the money aspect but rather than working for a company for 6 months, you get your own clients and work as a sole entrepreneur. This means that not only do you work as a developer, but you take on the role of a business negotiator, marketer and many others to find clients and get them to hire you to do a project. This avenue may be more difficult but it can be much more rewarding in terms of money or otherwise.

At first glance, the first option seems the best but it may not be for you. I'll dig into that further in a later chapter.
