title: It's not all programming
----
content:

Programming is great, and it's a wonderful job, hobby, and some could say, lifestyle. We've all heard of "hackers" and "tinkerers" that spend day and night coding and the stereotype is that this is how we all are, secluded in a dungeon with a monitor in front of us and the windows covered. Well, except for front-end developers who tend to have neatly organized desks in empty rooms and hipster clothes.

But stereotypes rarely reflect reality especially in this case. Developers are just as varied of a group as any. In fact, I know lots of developers that program in the day time but spend their free time completely differently.

What's also interesting is that what you do outside of programming matters a lot in terms of what you do when you program.

Ever heard of Archimedes? He was an ancient greek mathematician/physicist/philosopher who was tasked with finding a method through which to distinguish silver from a fake in the King's crown without melting the crown down (to find its density). According to the story, Archimedes worked day and night on the problem without being able to find a solution but could not. Finally, he decided to take a break and take a bath. When he sat down in the bath, he noticed that the water rose proportionally to displace the volume of his body. Using that principle, he was able to calculate the volume of the crown without melting it into a container and subsequently the density in order to verify the crown's silver.

Developers do much the same thing and many developers benefit from not focusing on development 24/7 but rather finding other tasks to do that switch up their thinking patterns.

## Not all stereotype

First of all, let's talk about the stereotypes. Developers are programmers so there is already a stigma attached to the profession, same as programming in general. The average developer according to media is an obsessed man that cannot once divert his attention from programming, except possibly for the purposes of gaming or watching sci-fi, or possibly playing Dungeons and Dragons. In fact, this man lives in a basement with covered with windows, several monitors radiating brightly, hacking away at an application while hacking the pentagon, or something like that.

The stereotype has started to change recently with many programmers becoming fast-paced entrepreneurs and big names in the tech industry at large. No longer was the industry controlled by business people that knew nothing of technology but rather, it started being controlled by the creators of technology themselves. This meant that developers started being associated with laid-back college kids that dressed in ironic t-shirts that could hack-away day and night.

However, strangely enough, in my line of work I've not met either kind. Well, there are quite a few ironic t-shirts but only because every employer I've worked with allowed a loose dress-code as is the fashion among smaller companies and startups. Outside of that, every person was different from another. From a co-worker who was quite the ladies' man, to a father of three who did nothing but spend time with his kids, to a slew of developers with active lifestyles hiking and riding bikes rather than coding.

In fact, if you had met any of these people outside of the workplace, you wouldn't know what they did whatsoever. So I think that stereotypes in general are starting to really loosen up.

## Hobbies

Non-tech hobbies are freaking amazing especially in terms of their impact on development. Most developers I know do at least a few things outside of coding, from photography to traveling, they engage in all sorts of activities. And so should you. Developing non-stop can lead to a burnout, and we've already talked about the consequences of that. What I haven't talked about is how an ease of mind, and switching tracks can help you solve the most difficult problems.

What I suggest to you is two-fold.

### Tech hobbies

First, tech hobbies. Tech hobbies are just as important as non-tech hobbies; however, they have different requirements. If you want to do something tech-related, try to do something that's vastly different from what you do every day. For example, if you do web development, why don't grab an Arduino, and work on creating some kind of an automated system? Or if you want to, try to get into game development or even server administration for fun?

The point of a tech hobby is to take your mind off your regular job but still be able to get into that type of an environment full of imaginative and creative people that use technology. I personally found Arduino development to be very mind-freeing and gets me to think vastly differently. Game development alike let's me have a break since it requires differen design patterns and often, it requires a completely different programming language, game art, and game design.

Getting another tech hobby allows you to be introduced to a technical world that never appears in your every day job. It introduces new algorithms, patterns, and different ways of thinking. Arduino, for example, works on a constant update loop that checks if it should run another piece of logic. Game development is somewhat similar to that except that the update loop often tries to update large OO entities.

And what about design? I consider web design a valid tech hobby but vastly different from development. It's definitely a wonderful creative outlet that gets you thinking not about how to get something done code-wise but how it should look to get its job done, or even how it should *act* to get a job done.

Obviously, do any of these *only* when you feel inclined to do so. I definitely don't advocate spending all your time on a computer trying to learn as much about tech as possible.

So if you find it relaxing, and you find it beneficial, and you like it, get a tech hobby!

### Non-tech hobbies

Non-tech hobbies are pretty awesome in that, they allow the mind to fully relax from its usual code-style problem-solving mind into a different shape. The mind is an elastic mind and the more you stretch it every-which way (without breaking it!), the better it will be at springing back and springing out. Having an artistic outlet, for instance, helps your mind to think of aesthetics and expression rather than "solving", while doing woodwork helps your mind focus on possibly repetitive tasks and controlling your body rather than staring at a monitor.

On top of that, it is a sure way to preventing a burnout. It really is. I repeat: non-tech hobbies are the best way for a developer to prevent a burnout.

There are so many awesome things you can do.

Check out fitness and working out. Not only is it great for your health, but it's very far removed from tech. Running is great for chemically resetting your brain, and so are other types of workouts. After a run, you'll feel refreshed and it's a great way to transition from your workday to your time off.

You can also go the artistic way and pick up painting or photography (very popular among devs) which explore your creative side.

Now, not only do non-tech hobbies prevent burnouts, help you feel better and function better, but there's also the Archimedes story.

Archimedes was able to find a solution by no longer focusing on the problem. I can't stress how often this happens. In fact, it happens so often, that at one work-place, we had regular coffee breaks and walking breaks whenever we needed to get away from a problem, only to come back and have a solution.

## Don't let your life be consumed

All in all, don't let your life be consumed by one thing. Life is grand, and full of adventures and there's no need to spend every waking minute programming, and there's no need to use all your free time trying to perfect that *one app*.
