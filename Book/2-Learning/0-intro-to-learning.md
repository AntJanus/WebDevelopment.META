Maybe I'm jumping the gun here but one of the best ways to get into web development is by diving right into it. There are several ways to do that. The way I, personally, learned web development was very haggard. I started with HTML, then I went a little into CSS, finally I dove into PHP. At that point, I relearned HTML/CSS from scratch and took my sweet time learning Javascript later on.

There are, also, other ways such as going the traditional Computer Science way, learning C and C++ along the way until finally reaching the web.

The cool thing about web development is that YOU choose how you get there, no one else. It does not have degree requirements, or certification requirements. You're pretty much in a place where you have to learn how to do it and how to do it well.

So let's get started!
