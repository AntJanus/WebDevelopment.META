title: Finding a Good Course
----
content:

Enough of choices, let's dive into the specifics. Where do you find a good source? There are plenty of sites and at the risk of possibly endorsing a site that may not be as good anymore or in the future, let me give you a nice neat list of some online courses:

### Team TreeHouse

Team Treehouse is among the leaders in getting people from not knowing any programming to developing full-scale apps. That's pretty much what they do. I believe their entire commercials focus on "I wanted to make websites, didn't know how to, so I went with Team Treehouse". I've personally used it for a couple of lessons and my friends had great success with it as well.

The curriculum is structured to throw you right in and get stuff done as quickly as possible without wasting time. I believe it's a great way to start web development learning and after several months transition into full self-learning

**Positive**

* Team Treehouse gets frequently updated that means that their lesson list expands and their content is always up to date with the latest practices
* The curriculum has two avenues. One of them lets you explore concepts further, the other one lets you focus on developing projects. This is great since it allows you to study theory and practice
* The courses teach not just web development but web design and business related to working at the web.

**Negative**

* There is a limited number of courses. Some of the other options have a much wider selection of courses.

## TutsPlus Premium

TutsPlus is a blog with a variety of tutorials on a variety of topics. They offer a premium feature which offers various courses as well. I haven't used their premium offering before; however, I have checked out some of their free courses and they operate on a similar basis as Team Treehouse, albeit less driven toward a single goal. They have a variety of topics that focuses on specific technologies.

I think that they are a great SECOND step to learning rather than first since there is no clear-cut path in their curriculum for beginners. But once you get the hang of the basics, it's definitely a good place to visit.

**Positive**

* TutsPlus has a wealth of articles and tutorials on various specific technologies. If there is a specific framework or tool you'd like to use, TutsPlus probably has a tutorial for it.
* Courses cover a range of various topics.

**Negative**

* Courses feel incomplete sometimes. They publish often, they publish a lot but often, they're incomplete
* There is no clear path to learn everything. You'll have to do your own research on what to learn.

## Udemy

Udemy is a little bit of a different beast as far as learning. Udemy is a marketplace of courses by different publishers rather than by a single one. You can pick and choose courses and, the best thing is, some courses are free.

This creates an interesting situation where you can find some of the top developers in the field, creating their own courses and publishing them. Or companies creating their courses as well.

**Positive**

* Thorough courses. Many courses have multiple parts and they go very deeply into their topics.
* No time limit. Once you buy a course, you own it.
* Review system which allows you to pick the correct course to pick.

**Negative**

* Per-course payment can be a little steep at first.
* The wealth of courses can be confusing at first.

## Lynda

Lynda is one of the older course providers out there and because of that it has a large wealth of courses both new and older. Among them are instructions by language and instructions by program. The advantage that Lynda has is that each language course has a beginner and intermediate course, meaning that whichever first language you'd like do to with, Lynda will have a course to supplement it.

**Positive**

* courses provide several different avenues of learning programming. Depending on the language and application
* there is a large variety of courses available under a single subscription (rivaling Udemy).
* courses are concept and project based just like TeamTreehouse

**Negative**

* with no rating system, it can be difficult to browse the catalog; however, it's become easier over time.
* some of the courses may feel dated and it can be a bummer learning from something not following modern techniques. But again, Lynda's been good at renewing their courses.

## Other Alternatives

Of course, paid courses aren't the only way to get in; however, I've found most of the options above to be more than satisfactory for personal learning. And at $20-$30/month it's no large expenditure. So if you'd like to take on something free first and make sure this is what you want to do, here are some of the options.

### CodeAcademy

CodeAcademy is a free course-learning platform that teaches one to code. It has several languages to learn as well: Python, Ruby, and PHP, even Javascript. So it's definitely a good place to look at. They even have a step-by-step making your first website.
