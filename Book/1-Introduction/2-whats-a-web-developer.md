title: What is a web developer?

We've discussed what web development is in essence, the programming of webpages: whether it's the more experience-centric front-end development or the data/logic-driven back-end development. You'd think that the simple answer to our question is that a web developer programs webpages. It's right, but not quite a full answer.

A web developer is an individual that takes on certain responsibilities when it comes to creating websites, not just the programming itself. Let's go through a day of an imaginary mid-level web developer named "Suzy".

**Suzy**

Suzy gets to work on Monday morning. First thing she does is check her email to see if there have been any critical bugs or problems that need to be addressed. If there is nothing, she's welcome to move onto her main project for the day. If there is a bug and no one has been assigned to fix it, she may self-assign it to herself and start working on it. And it looks like no one has taken care of it.

Suzy opens her favorite web editor, loads up her current project, a large website with a great deal of "business logic" behind it. It turns out that the payment system incorrectly applies tax to a purchase. Suzy starts looking through the payment system files, remembering the class system under which the payment system functions. After a couple of hours of tinkering, she finds out that the system never tries to match up a zipcode to a specific tax, instead, it defaults to another value. She makes the change but she's not done yet.

If she's working with many other developers, she may be using version control, a system that allows many developers to work together on the same code, non-destructively. She, first, writes a test program to ensure that if someone else submits a change, the test suite will warn them in case they broke this part of the system. Second, she submits her change to the version control system and assigns a co-worker to look over her code, in case she missed something.

Luckily, Suzy has a couple of hours before lunch so she decides to review the code of several co-workers. There is one brand new feature to the system that allows international customers to switch to any number of languages. Luckily, the change was not as complicated as she feared. Her co-worker implemented a new system for retrieving text from the database based on language. Suzy was glad that it was not the old days where she would have had to look over hundreds of pages in numerous languages to ensure everything was correct. All of the text was in the database and so she never had to deal with it.

After lunch, Suzy finally started working on her main project, adding a blog to their sales platform in order to allow the marketing team to make announcements through the site. It would have been a trivial feature; however, the marketing team requested the ability to schedule blog posts and to require manager approval for posting ahead of schedule. She inquired about the specifications to find out if a writer can prompt for manager approval or if the manager has to do it themselves.

As you can see, most of Suzy's day was not taken up with coding HTML or any of the other languages. In fact, most of her day was taken up with the "human" side of web development: getting specifications, fixing problems, getting feedback on code, reviewing code, and creating web tests. Of course, not every day is the same. Some days, Suzy may spend her time researching a new technology for the system, or she may spend her entire day shut off from the world coding away. Depending on her position, she may have additional duties.
