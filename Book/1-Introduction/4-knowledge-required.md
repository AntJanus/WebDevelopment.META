Some time ago, I gave a talk on "how to be a developer", it was my precursor to this book. One big part of my talk was the discussion of skills that developers *have* to have. This includes skills required by the job, and skills required to actually be *good* and *employable*.

One of the hardest concept to get across was that **development does not equal coding**. A web developer is more than just a "code monkey". If you're not familiar with the term, it's a metaphor to describe how developers used to be treated 20 or so years ago when a developer was just that, a code monkey. Someone incapable of doing anything other than translating managerial specs into code.

Today, a developer is much more. This is very visible among startups where developers often have to take over other roles, and become the entire senior staff at the company. On top of that, many startups are founded by developers or former developers that became enterpreneurs.

So what does a developer need to know? Depending on the job and level (junior, mid, senior), there are different requiriments but there are some common ones:

1. a server-side language
2. HTML
3. CSS
4. javascript

And that's just on the code side. As a developer you should be aware of:

1. project management
2. learning
3. communication
4. ability to asess program or spec
5. writing ability

A lot of these come hand-in-hand. Ability to assess a project will quickly translate into managing that project and communication with senior staff or other developers on how to proceed. Writing documentation and review code and discuss architecture will come next, especially when working among peers.

As far as learning, that's the greatest and worst part of being a coder. On the one hand, it's exciting to progress in your career, learn more, and help the development world evolve; however, on the other hand, it can be difficult to keep up with all the new stuff that comes about.

I've discussed the advances from WWW to SPA; however, there were many subtle steps between those strides and much more misteps.

But let's talk about our list of skills.

### Server side programming

While the development field is quickly becoming a field full of specialists, it's still important to go back and learn the general knowledge. Not so general as Computer Science but more general than Front-end UI Product Developer.

Despite the great advances in Javascript and keeping all of application logic in the browser, server-side programming is as important as ever. Perhaps not as much for templating but for other reasons.

So what does server-side programming entail? In short, anything to do with interacting with, well, a server. A server usually houses all of an application's data. The server-side of an application usually holds the more complex logic, and programming that's not safe to be exposed, like handling logins, security, and other elements.

SPAs today depend on the server-side application to store, retrieve, and update data as well as provide the front-end with necessary files that it needs. It has to be speedy, and able to handle a large number of users at once. The front-end, luckily, doesn't have such responsibilities.

There are several server-side languages that are very popular today and we'll go over those in the next section.

### HTML/CSS

The completely basic components of the web are HTML and CSS. Whether there is a server-side programming language involved, or Javascript dictating behavior in the browser, HTML and CSS is always present. It is possible to build without CSS but it is highly uncommon (read: 100% of the modern web uses CSS).

The knowledge of these two components is crucial; however, your expertise may range depending on your position. A Javascript developer will be intimately knowledgeable of HTML but may not know much more than basic CSS. A back-end (server-side) developer may know only the basics of either.

### Javascript

Javascript became crucial to web development only in the recent years and thus many developers still struggle with the concept of javascript programming. It's difficult to grasp at first, it's unlike server-side programming and it works in real-time, there's no "refresh" so to speak.

However, it is the bread and butter of a front-end developer and it is THE language to facilitate some kind of interaction for the user, right there on the page. Whether it's a popup, a chat window and conversation, or what drives web gaming.

### Project Management

The art of PM is a sacred one, in that few understand, and even fewer exercise it. It's most apparent when working as a freelancer where project management often involves prodding a client for information and materials necessary to complete the project and subsequently adjusting deadlines.

And while you may work somewhere where a project manager does the initial sifting of assignments, you will always be in control of the few projects you have. What takes priority? How long will it take? How long will that hiccup push the deadline? These are all important questions. PM encompasses everything from time estimation to communication with others and synchronizing efforts.

### Learning

As I've said, Learning is both a plague and a gift. If you stop learning, you'll quickly become obsolete. Many jQuery developers are realizing that now. For the un-enlightened, jQuery is one of the most popular Javascript libraries on the internet. Chances are, you've used several websites with jQuery on it just today, and probably in the past two hours. The problem is that the web is evolving and the methodology that is so inheret to working with jQuery is no longer acceptable for full-sized apps.

If you don't learn the new advanced methodologies, you'll fall off. The positive is that there is always room for improvement, and new niches to escape into. Brand new frameworks tend to spring up in hundreds but only a few survive and those that do may have wide adoption but a small number of developers that are knowledgeable. Thus it's easy for people to become master from being a novice.

Just remember that half your job may depend on you learning a new framework that will ultimately save you from hundreds of hours of pain with an old framework.

### Communication

While developers are often seen as reclusive, it is not a good trait to have as a developer. In fact, most of the developers I've run across are not reclusive at all but very sociable and informative, especially about their job. Communication is important between a developer and a client, manager, or a project manager. Without it, it's difficult to let a supervisor know that you're burning out, or that you've stumbled on a problem with no apparent solution.

And yes, these things happen. As the saying goes:

>Even a greybeard will drop production DB.

Being able to respond and correctly communicate needs is crucial to your career.

Also, just think of all the open source projects out there, they're littered with heated discussions over the most minute changes and updates!

As a word of warning, as a developer, you will have to defend your work and your decisions in front of many people. Supervisors often have a mentality of "getting it done no matter the consequences" which can lead to technical debt, system slow downs, and possibly entire application crashes (or application bankruptcy). Being able to hold your ground or at least have a supervisor sign off on personal responsibility will be an important aspect of your job.

###  Ability to assess program or spec

Something along the lines of what I've discussed. A good developer can look at a spec outline and see holes, problems, pitfalls right away. The ability to estimate a project and what will go into it is very important since it can be the difference between a successful smooth ride and development hell.

For instance, a vague spec is a recipe for disaster. From misunderstandings to runaway scope, it's known to be the worst thing for a developer, especially a freelancer. On the other hand, a 60-page detailed spec is a problem too since it can be too inflexible.

There's also the issue of "is it possible?" and then, "can it be done well?" and estimating the difference between the two.

### Writing Ability

Last but not least is writing ability. Again, this goes hand in hand with all the other topics. Writing ability is important for several reasons. One of them is communication with others, but the other has to do with documentation. Documentation and instructions on setting up a system and more.

Many developers indulge in blogging, writing tutorials, and doing post-mortems (system analysis after a major event). All of that takes writing. And so does, for instance, writing up specs and style guides for code.
