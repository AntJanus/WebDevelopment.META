Let's back track a little bit. Instead of asking "what is web development", let's ask a couple of other questions:

1. What is programming?
2. How does the internet work?

The first question may sound self-evident but it's actually much more difficult to answer than any of the others. Programming is, in fact, a blackbox that rarely anyone outside of the programming fields glimpses into. The media often portrays it as a malicious tool that no one should wield while startup investors see a sort of engine that converts money into...well, more money. Managers often see it as a necessary evil in business-growth and programmers see it as the solution to all of the world's problems.

Programming, in essence, is the creation of instructions for a computer to digest and follow. It usually involves a programming language, a language that humans can learn and wield, and an intermediate step (or several) that convert the programming language into a lower-level language until finally it reaches 1's and 0's that the CPU and other computer parts can understand without question.

What's important for programmers today is seeing the ground that their efforts have been built on. For instance, the intermediate language one step above our 1's and 0's (also called the "Machine Language") called Assembly, requires a lot of work to use and make it run. However, it is still much easier than typing in 1's and 0's in succession to manually create our instructions. A language that exists right above it is, again, magnitudes easier and thus enable us, programmers, to do much more complicated things.

C++ is such a language and virtually any program can be built in. It has wide-reaching applications from embedded systems, to operating systems, to servers, video games and everything else. It is one of the most versatile languages out there. However, it can be difficult to learn and thus further abstractions come into play.

Several levels up, we finally get to a web browser. A web browser may be built in C++ and what's interesting is that it doesn't do everything by itself. So another important tenet of programming is to create programs that make other programs easier to run. In this case, the operating system, built in C++ as well, takes care of running the processor, running several processes at once, interacting with the rest of the hardware, and running the browser itself as well as allowing it to communicate with others parts of the system. The web browser makes it access graphics on the screen by translating HTML (HyperText Markup Language) and CSS (Cascading Stylesheets) into instructions that are then sent to the OS and make their way down all the levels until finally accessing the machine.

Now, this may sound complicated and it is but it's much easier if you allow yourself to focus on only your level of complexity and a little around it. In time, you'll start to see these large patterns, abstraction and communication within layers, the longer you program.

So, in conclusion, programming involves a fine art of making it easier and quicker to make complex computer instructions.

But we still haven't discussed how the internet works. For a web developer, knowing the background behind how their code runs is crucial to being a successful developer. It also enables a developer to communicate better with others in adjoining fields such as system administrators, devOps, and similar.

At its core, internet is pretty simple. It's a huge web of wires that allow computers to communicate with each other. Back in '90, Berners-Lee and Cailliau came up with a proposal for hypertext (what became HTML) and gave rise to WWW or the World Wide Web. These two guys realized that there could be a better way for computers to communicate. A more, "user friendly" method that would allow people to "browse freely" through exposed documents on another machine.

This idea augmented the way people interacted with the internet, making it a more accessible place for people outside of academics, government, and business. Soon enough, domains (such as `example.com`) came to be (a sort of "alias" for an IP address), HTML was widely adopted and we started progressing toward the internet we know and love today.

And this, finally brings us to what web development is. Web Development is the process through which a web page is created. Whenever you open some kind of site through your internet browser, you access a web page that was developed by a web developer.

However, as easy-sounding as it is, it can be much more complicated. The Web started with "static" pages, which were websites precoded in HTML. These sites dominated the world until server-side scripting languages took over. First used for templating, and later as a way to truly "program" the web page. In this case, programming allows us to put any kind of instructions that need to be carried out and reflected on a web page.

We can, for instance, use a server-side programming language to get information from a database, do some post-processing on it, and display it in a format that is pleasing to us.

What's great is that the adoption of internet and the boom it caused in businesses allowed several key technologies to emerge: javascript, and CSS. Javascript allows us to do **front-end development** while server-side languages allow us to indulge in **back-end development**. And what Javascript did was allow us to interact with websites more fluidly. For example, we could try to submit a comment on a website and Javascript would let us know, as we type, that we did not make it long enough, even before we submit our information to the server.

Cascasding Style Sheets, on the other hand, allowed us to design more usable websites and websites that were pleasing to look at. The art of applying these styles and designing with them eventually became a cross between **UI development** and the aforementioned front-end development.

The next question to ask is, What is a web developer?
