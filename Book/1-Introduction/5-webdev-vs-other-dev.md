title: Web Dev vs Other Dev
----
content:

I've talked a lot about the roles of web developers and how their entire field evolved. But there is another interesting topic to touch on. Why a web developer? Why not a game developer? Or an app developer? Or even a desktop developer?

Programming has a wide range of options to consider regarding specialization. Web development is currently booming but what of game development? Everyone loves video games, right?

The main difference is money and where it goes. With web development, the money goes to the companies that develop the strongest platforms and into startups that are "disruptive". Both of these depend on developers and are sometimes even headed by developers. They are the pure profit-driving machines in a new world of unlimited profit.

Web development startups are in a position where materials are cheap, companies are small, and the turned profit can be explosively high. Existing companies see this as well, and adopt this. Programming can be difficult to learn and the craft requires skilled professionals that know what they're doing. The amount of money poured into these developers usually ends up in a high profit.

The problem starts when other industries don't work this way. Game developers face the fact that it's not developers that control the market but game publishers. It's a multi-billion dollar industry that behaves closer to the movie industry rather than the web development industry. Developers are often not treated well, they can find themselves having a hard time finding work, and may not make as much money.

It's still rewarding work and many choose this avenue. I never advise anyone to take a job just for the job market, that's nonsensical. On top of that, the Indie industry is starting to help overturn this "employers' market".

But a little about game development. Game development is interesting in that it deals with much different stuff than web development (other than web game development). The language selection is a little different (C++, C#, Objective-C, Java, Python, etc. vs PHP, Ruby, Python, C#..wait a second!), and the paradigms are shifted. Architecture is much more important and unfortunately, there is no equivalent in game development to the good old simple times of "static websites".

There's also the necessity of learning 3D modeling or at least concepts, linear algebra, and math.

So what else is there? App development? App development is slowly merging with web development but granted, there are less app developers than web developers and one might find that avenue lucrative and fun. It's a place full of innovation, especially with rapid cell phone advancements and the wealth of software access phone makers create. Both Android and iOS give app developers a great deal of new APIs (think of an API as a way to access a piece of hardware or software outside of your app). It's a booming market.

As far as desktop application development, I would say that outside of enterprise-level work, it's a limited field of work, especially now that everything is being offloaded onto the web. However, if you like the enterprise, this is a great option!
