title: Microsoft Windows vs \*Nix systems

A popular myth among the development communities is that true developers use any tool X that's currently popular. Even more popular is a myth that the most badass developers use OS X and Macs. It's not entirely true but there are reasons why many developers prefer Macs over Windows.

First and foremost, I don't want to stir up a battle. I personally use Windows, OSX, and different flavors of Linux all the time to developer, write, and enjoy. And I know plenty of developers that have their preferences. What's important is what makes sense for *you*.

## Linux

Linux is an operating system that pretty much dominates the server world. Along with OpenBSD and Windows, it's one of the several picked operating systems that are used on servers. There are several reasons for that. One of them being that Linux works on just about any device, it's fully open source (and thus accepts fixes/bugs/patches even custom ones), and finally, it's commandline interface is extremely powerful. Not only that, today, most open source software runs on Linux first and other platforms last.

Given that, Linux has a pretty cool system of adjusting it, tweaking it, and working with other open source software. The cool thing is that, you can use Linux as your main operating system in lieu of OS X or Windows. Both Macs and traditional PCs support Linux. Now, server Linux is stripped down to work specifically on servers with specific drivers, utilities, and being light-weight so that the software can maximize its resource usage.

There are desktop flavors of Linux. Ubuntu, Fedora, and Arch being the most popular (them and their derivatives). They can be fully utilized with a graphical interface. It works just like server linux except that it has a greater wealth of utilities and that graphical interface (another, separate application) which allows regular non-tech users use the software. The UI on today's Linux distros is *very* advanced and either on par with OS X and Windows or exceeding their capabilities. It used to be a hurdle to get through but today, the UIs are revolutionary, and highly useful.

Working on such a system allows us to run software as if it was on a server. This helps with testing, learning about the system and setting stuff up works the same way on both systems. The Linux world is filled with all kinds of amazing open source apps so there's no shortage of that.

Another reason to use Linux is that whenever a company comes out with a utility for a server, it'll automatically be able to run on your machine. For example, Facebook released a utility called Watchman which helps watch thousands of files, or browse through them using an API (it can be used by VIM to cache a file directory). It was released to work with servers and Linux developers quickly picked it up. Then, it started migrating to other platforms.
