content:

A popular myth among the development communities is that true developers use any tool X that's currently popular. Even more popular is a myth that the most badass developers use OS X and Macs. It's not entirely true but there are reasons why many developers prefer Macs over Windows.

First and foremost, I don't want to stir up a battle. I personally use Windows, OSX, and different flavors of Linux all the time to developer, write, and enjoy. And I know plenty of developers that have their preferences. What's important is what makes sense for *you*.
