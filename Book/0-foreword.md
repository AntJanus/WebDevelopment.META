Web development is an amazing field to enter for a great number of reasons. From great pay and benefits, to the low barrier of entry, it's the perfect job for someone who enjoys programming, logical thinking, and problem solving. I believe that there is no other position today that offers such amazing advantages as web development, not even other types of development.

To embark on this journey, one must accept several things about their job. First, they're never finished with learning, and second, enjoyment drives your career. Unlike in other positions and job markets, web development requires a passion and joy in the product making.

I am writing this book mainly to encourage others to enter the field, to get a job worthy of their efforst, and to advance further. The field is largely a mystery to most people even to those in the field itself. We are mostly unaware of how others could enter the field and how to advance. Other than our own personal journey, there is no frame of reference. However, that is the exact beauty of this field, there are many avenues of entering it and many more avenues of advancing in it.

All the aspects and facest of webdev get quickly confusing. So I decided to split the book into several parts:

1. introduction to webdev
2. learning webdev
3. getting employed
4. becoming better at what you do
5. diving into personal projects
6. the "meta" of programming
7. tools and their differnces
8. health and webdev
