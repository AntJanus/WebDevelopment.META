content: 

Git has Github. One of the most popular projects (Bootstrap) has 67K stars and 24K forks.

Many popular frameworks have moved from SVN to Git (Rails and PHP).

Mercurial: not as big but Facebook recently switched to it.

Version control  outside of web development differs. Companies such as NVidia and Ubisoft use a commercial alternative called Perforce.
